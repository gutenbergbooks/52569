<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="bbox2"><p>“An editor, or a translator, collects the merits
of different writers, and, forming all into a wreath,
bestows it on his author’s tomb.”—<span class="smcap">Shenstone.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> world is indebted to the late Professor Karl
Friedrich Neumann, for having rendered the perusal
of Johann Schiltberger’s travels generally accessible.
Until his edition of the Heidelberg MS. appeared, in
1859, there had been no publication of the interesting
work, in its integrity, since the year 1700, the supposed
date of an edition, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine anno, sine loco</em>; so that,
as a fact, the work had become scarce, and could be
consulted in a few libraries only, or in private collections
of rare books. In 1813, and again in 1814, was
published Abraham Jacob Penzel’s edition of what was
known as the Nuremberg MS.; but its sole merit
consisted in the insertion of Proper and Geographical
names in their original orthography, the work being
otherwise vitiated by its modern and paraphrased
style, and by the introduction of passages, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">ii</a></span>
which Schiltberger never could have been the
author.</p>

<p>Scheiger<a name="FNanchor_1_p" id="FNanchor_1_p"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_p" class="fnanchor">1</a> condemns this book as being written in a
very extraordinary and uncommonly empty style, in
which the narrative of the honest old Bavarian drags
itself along very uncouthly. Tobler<a name="FNanchor_2_p" id="FNanchor_2_p"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_p" class="fnanchor">2</a> stigmatises it as
being an unhappy translation into modern German,
with no Introduction; and Neumann,<a name="FNanchor_3_p" id="FNanchor_3_p"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_p" class="fnanchor">3</a> a still severer
critic, says:—“This edition, in its modern garb, does
honour to nobody. The additions to the original text
are absurd, and testify to the editor’s ignorance of
Schiltberger’s character, and of the times in which he
lived. Take, for instance, the following sentence, with
which Penzel concludes the author’s address to the
reader:—‘Just as the doctor smears with honey the
glass of physic prepared for a sick child, so have I also,
as an agreeable pastime, introduced here and there
some wonderful stories which, I flatter myself, will
prove agreeable and instructive reading.’” Neumann
might have added, that Penzel was not even the
originator of the idea conveyed in this passage,
evidently borrowed from Tasso!</p>

<p>In 1823 these travels were again published, in 8vo.,
at Munich; but this is a copy of which it would seem
that very little is known.</p>

<p>Judging by the numerous editions of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, each issue being an almost
exact transcript of the copy that preceded it, Schiltberger
must have been a popular author during that
period. One long blank occurs from 1557 to 1606,
after which the book of travels was not again reprinted
until 1700.</p>

<p>The version now offered is a literal translation of
Neumann’s edition in mittelhoch Deutsch, an exact
transcript of the Heidelberg MS., with the exception
of a few errors that have been rectified, and slight
alterations in the headings of some chapters. Neumann
believes his book to be the first printed edition that
faithfully represents what Schiltberger wrote, the
wording in all previous editions having been changed
to suit the language of the times. He has added an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
Introduction and Notes by himself, and Notes by Fallmerayer
and Hammer-Purgstall; such of those Notes
as are referred to in the new Notes at the end of this
volume, appear in their proper places at foot in the
text, each bearing the initial of the writer.</p>

<p>Koehler<a name="FNanchor_4_p" id="FNanchor_4_p"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_p" class="fnanchor">4</a> finds fault very unsparingly with Neumann,
whom he reproaches with neglect in not correcting
and elucidating the wording of the text.
Tobler, on the contrary, considers Neumann’s work
more acceptable than Penzel’s unfortunate translation
into modern German, because there is an Introduction,
and the Oriental names employed by the
author are explained.</p>

<p>The travels of Johann Schiltberger had never been
translated into any tongue until Professor Bruun’s
edition, in Russian, appeared at Odessa in 1866;
although a somewhat free interpretation of the original,
it has been of no small assistance to me where
passages in the old German seemed obscure, as also in
the identification of names. I am under a deep sense
of gratitude to that learned gentleman, for having enriched
my translation with a large number of most
valuable and interesting Notes. They were supplied
to me in French, and to ensure their faithful repro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>duction,
my MS. in the first instance, and the proofs
afterwards, were sent to Odessa, for the Professor’s corrections
or alterations, and approval.</p>

<p>I have to express my thanks to Aly Bey Riza,
Cadri Bey, and Rassek Bey of Alexandria, for their
kind aid in simplifying the Turkish and Arabic
sentences that occur in various chapters; to Mr.
Mnatzakan Hakhoumoff, of Shousha, for making clear
to me the several phrases in Armenian; and to Dr.
Niccolo Quartano de Calogheras, of Corfu, for his
explanation of customs and rites as they are now
observed in the Greek Church. I am also desirous of
acknowledging the courtesy of those gentlemen who
have been good enough to reply to my enquiries,
for information that would assist me in compiling a
Bibliography of existing editions of Schiltberger’s
travels; and it gives me much pleasure to name the
Rev. Leo Alishan, Venice; Dr. K. A. Barack, Strasburg;
the Rev. A. Baumgarten, at the Kremsmünster
near Wels; Mr. A. Bytschkoff, St. Petersburg; Mr.
E. Förstemann, Dresden; Mr. A. Gutenæker, Munich;
M. Edouard Hesse, Paris; Professor Heyd, Stuttgard;
Dr. M. Isler, Hamburg; Mr. J. Kraenzler, Augsburg;
Professor Lepsius, Berlin; Dr. J. E. A. Martin, Jena;
Dr. Noack, Giessen; Dr. Joh. Priem, Nuremberg; Dr.
E. Ritter von Birk, Vienna; Dr. G. T. Thomas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Munich; and Professor Karl Zangemeister, Heidelberg;
also the Principal Librarian of the public library
at Frankfort, and of the Bibliotheca Medicea-Laurentiana
at Florence. I have likewise to express my
obligations to Colonel Yule, for some useful and
timely hints, so readily given.</p>

<p>Many of the Proper and Geographical names that
occur in the Notes, and they are very numerous, are
spelled as they ordinarily appear in English works, the
orthography of the rest being in accordance with their
pronunciation by a Persian and an Armenian gentleman,
who did me the favour to settle my doubts. It
being impossible to produce certain sounds with vowels
that are so variously pronounced in the English
language, I have had recourse to giving a phonetic
value to various letters, in some instances accentuating
the word for the sake of stress, with the acute or grave
accent as in the Greek. The apostrophe ’ denotes an
independent but rather soft breathing of a letter.</p>

<p class="tb">1. A MS. of Schiltberger’s travels, undoubtedly of the
fifteenth century, preserved in the University Library
at Heidelberg and known as the Heidelberg MS., consists
of ninety-six carefully and neatly written sheets of paper,
in good style, and evidently the work of a professional
scribe. It is about eight inches long by six inches broad,
bound in leather, with bronze corner plates and clasps, and
bears on the upper board a portrait in gold of the Elector,
with the initials O. H.—P. C., Otto Heinrich—Palatinus
Comes, and the date 1558. Another date, 1443, probably
the year in which the MS. was written, appears inside the
binding, which is beautifully ornamented with illustrations
from the Old and New Testaments. This volume was included
in the Palatine Library that was carried off by
Tilly in 1621, and presented by Maximilian, duke of Bavaria,
to Gregory XV. as a trophy of the Catholic cause.
After the general peace of 1815, Pius VII. restored the
collection to Heidelberg, at the instance of the King of
Prussia.</p>

<p class="tb">2. The ducal library at Donaueschingen possesses a MS.
on paper, of the fifteenth century, consisting of 134 leaves
in sheepskin boards, with brass corner plates and clasps.
The work is contemporary with the Heidelberg MS., or at
all events not of a later period.</p>

<p class="tb">4. In 1488, a MS. of Schiltberger’s travels was in the
possession of a Receiver of Revenue, named Matthias
Bratzl, who caused it to be bound in one volume, with
MSS. of Marco Polo, St. Brandon, Sir John Mandevile, and
Ulrich of Frioul, and then wrote on the fly-leaf a note to
the following effect:—“Having acquired the herein-named
books, I have had them bound together, and have added a
valuable and accurate map. Should the reader of these
writings not know where the countries are, whose customs
and habits are described, they are to look into the map.
The map will also serve to complete what may be wanting
in the books, and indicate the roads by which the travellers
went. The map and the books quite agree. Whoever
inherits this volume after my death, is to leave the different
books together, and the map with them.” When Gottlieb
von Murr, the distinguished bibliographer and antiquary
(1733–1811), saw the volume, the map was missing.</p>

<p>This MS. was originally at Munich, but being sent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>Nuremberg for the purpose of being published, was there
kept in the city library. Schlichtegroll, the biographer,
sanctioned the loan of it to Penzel, who turned its contents
into modern German, producing the editions of 1813 and
1814. Penzel died at Jena in 1819, leaving his body to
the anatomical theatre, his books to the public library, and
all his debts to the grand-duke of Weimar. He had not returned
the MS., and it was never afterwards recovered.
Neumann thinks that it may have been in the author’s own
handwriting.</p>

</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> any reliance is to be placed in a MS. marginal note
that appears on a page of an old edition of the Travels
of Schiltberger, presumed to be of the year 1551,
and preserved at Wels in Austria,<a name="FNanchor_1_i" id="FNanchor_1_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_i" class="fnanchor">1</a> then the author
of the work before us was born at mid-day on the
9th day of May—in the year 1381, according to his
own showing, because he states in the opening of his
narrative, that he had not yet attained his sixteenth
year when at the battle of Nicopolis (Sept. 28, 1396).
So completely does Schiltberger eschew all reference
to himself, that he leaves us quite in the dark even
with regard to the place of his birth; for, in addressing
the Reader, he states that his home was near the
city of Munich; but upon his return to Bavaria, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>proceeds to Frisingen, near which town he was born.
Nothing whatever is known of his parentage or childhood;
and that he has not remained entirely neglected
and forgotten is owed to Thurnmaier, better known
as Aventinus, who states, that upon his return from
bondage, Schiltberger was taken in hand by the duke
Albrecht III., and nominated his Chamberlain, an appointment
that was probably made, in Neumann’s
opinion, before the duke’s reign began, in 1438. This
is all the Bavarian annalist has to say of his interesting
countryman.</p>

<p>In the Introduction to his edition, Neumann offers
a few particulars on the Schiltberge family, as they
were communicated to him by Cölestin von Schiltberg,
Manager of the Royal Salt Mines at Reichenhall.</p>

<p>The origin of the ancient name of Schiltberger, or
Schiltberge, is not known, but it is, in all probability,
composite, from Schild—a coat of arms—and Berg,
the mount on which the arms were raised. A certain
Berchtholdus Marescalcus de Schiltberg is mentioned
in a document of the year 1190, and others of the
name appear at later dates as burghers, and marshals
to the dukes of Bavaria.<a name="FNanchor_2_i" id="FNanchor_2_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_i" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The Schiltberges of to-day trace their pedigree to
our author, who is styled Chamberlain and Commander
of the Body-guard to Albrecht III. Several of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>ancestors, during the 18th century, were Counsellors
in the Bavarian Electorate, and two Schiltberges,
Johann Peter and Franz Joseph, were Professors of
Law at the University of Ingolstadt. An Imperial
decree, dated March 27, 1786, raising three brothers
of the “ancient and noble lineage of Schiltberg” to
the dignity of nobles of the State, having been confirmed
by the Bavarian Electorate, the Schiltberges
have ever since been included in the peerage of Bavaria.</p>

<p>Neumann’s complaint that our author has never
been fully appreciated by his countrymen, appears to
be only too true; but the same cannot be said of
aliens. Leunclavius has availed himself largely, in his
<cite>Pandects</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_3_i" id="FNanchor_3_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_i" class="fnanchor">3</a> of the information supplied by an eye-witness,
for the purpose of illustrating the history of
the Turks; and in later times, such men as J. R.
Forster, M. C. Sprengel, J. Chr. von Engel, Hugh
Murray, Hammer, Scheiger, Aschbach, Vivien de Saint-Martin,
Fallmerayer, D’Avezac, Bruun, and Yule, have
borne witness to the worth of what Schiltberger has left
behind. If he is charged by Karamsin with making
confused and senseless statements, the historian at
least believes him to be truthful, and to have really
been at all the places he claims to have visited.</p>

<p>Johann Schiltberger left his home in the year 1394,
as he himself informs us, with his master, Leonard
Richartinger. That was two years before the battle
of Nicopolis was fought, ten months of which time be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>spent in Hungary, where his lord was in all probability
serving in the auxiliary forces under Sigismund,
king of that country. He must therefore have been
launched into the world when in his fourteenth year
only, and whatever the state of his education at that
early age, certainly no opportunities could have been
afforded him for improving it, during his long term of
servitude. The composition of his work, throughout,
and the diversified and undetermined mode of spelling
Proper and Geographical names, show that the scribe
was not a careful one, and tends to prove Schiltberger’s
inability to read what was written, and correct
the mistakes that were made; it is thus fairly conclusive,
I venture to say, that his book, like so many
other narratives of the Middle Ages, was written
under dictation, a fact exhibiting marvellous retention
of memory, when it is considered that the incidents
extend over the space of about thirty-three years.
That no journal was kept, is apparent from errors in
computation of time. Of this there are two striking
instances; the first, in the estimate of length of service
under Bajazet, from September 1396 to July
1402, which is calculated at twelve years; and the
author’s statement that he was six years with Timour,
when, as a matter of fact, the actual period extended
from July 1402 to February 1405.</p>

<p>Schiltberger no doubt dictated his adventures soon
after his return to his native country, because in the
concluding chapter he explains “how and through
what countries I have come away”. The various
incidents of his career in the East are recorded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>out
method, and were evidently related just as the
recollection of them occurred to him, so that the attempt
to follow in his footsteps, with any precision,
becomes a hopeless task; and irregularly interspersed
with his narrative, are descriptions of places and
events, that he learnt from hearsay only, not having
been either a spectator or participator. This inconsistent
and incongruous style, again, betokens the man
wanting in instruction; but every page affords evidence
of the intelligence, veracity, modesty, and high
principles of the honest-minded Bavarian; indeed
the whole, so straightforward, truthful, and certainly
useful, will compare favourably with the most trustworthy
of mediæval writers, not excepting even Marco
Polo. “Notwithstanding a few historical and geographical
errors,” says Hammer, “this book of Travels
remains a precious monument of the history and
topography of the middle ages, of which Bavarians
may be as justly proud as Venice is of her Marco
Polo.”<a name="FNanchor_4_i" id="FNanchor_4_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_i" class="fnanchor">4</a> There is nothing to show that Schiltberger
was a reading man, or that he availed himself of the
writings of others, except in one instance, in which it
can scarcely be doubted that he had recourse to some
authority when giving the dimensions of the walls of
Babylon, which coincide so exactly with what is found
recorded in Herodotus. How otherwise could the
poor slave have traced and verified such measurements?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span></p>

<p>Schiltberger has wisely distinguished what he heard
from what he himself saw, and therefore does not
hesitate to indulge in the recital of the marvellous
and ridiculous, without, however, the least touch of
humour or criticism. A battle was fought between
serpents and vipers, near Samsoun on the Black Sea
coast; not whilst he was in the city, but “during the
time I was with Bajazet”. Entering with childlike
pleasure into the fullest particulars on the Castle of
the Sparrow-hawk, he takes care to say, that when one
of his companions wanted to visit it and see the
virgin who resided there, nobody could be found to
show the way, because the castle was hidden by trees,
and the Greek priests also forbade approach to it.
Then there is the story of the destruction of the mirror
at Alexandria, related in the most perfect simplicity,
and, as is his custom, without a word of comment;
but that the Pope’s conduct was iniquitous in the
sight of good Schiltberger is very certain, for he seeks
to excuse his lesson of dissimulation to the priest, on
the plea that all was done “for the sake of the Christian
faith”. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vera sunt vera et falsa sunt falsa; sed si
ecclesia dicit vera esse falsa et falsa esse vera, falsa
sunt vera et vera sunt falsa.</span> If Bellarmine was really
the first to pen these lines, verily it was no new precept
that he was promulgating. Another instance of
Schiltberger’s appreciation of the truth is to be found
in his relation of the tale of the saintly man in Khorasan,
who had attained his three hundred and fiftieth
year. “So the Infidels said,” are the words added.
Such is the manner in which Schiltberger treats these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
and all the other absurd inventions to which he listened
in his leisure hours.</p>

<p>When the text is largely illustrated with Notes—in
the present work they form the greater part of the
volume—little room is left for introductory remarks;
nor is it necessary to recapitulate the substance of the
text. It will therefore suffice to give a rapid outline
of the author’s movements during his lengthened
captivity.</p>

<p>The battle of Nicopolis is the most important episode
in the busy and eventful career of Schiltberger,
whose circumstantial account of the action fully agrees
with what we learn from other sources. He escaped
the general massacre of prisoners, upon the defeat and
flight of Sigismund, through the timely intervention
of Souleiman, the eldest son of Bajazet. Thurnmaier
says that Schiltberger was spared on account of his
good looks, and at once appointed page to the Sultan;<a name="FNanchor_5_i" id="FNanchor_5_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_i" class="fnanchor">5</a>
but this is probably a fancy of the Bavarian annalist,
because it is very distinctly asserted in the text that
none under twenty were executed, and the youthful
captive was barely sixteen years of age. He suffered
considerably from the effects of three wounds, a circumstance
to which he casually and most modestly refers
in a subsequent chapter. Whilst in the service of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>Bajazet, he was employed as one of his personal attendants
in the quality of runner; he possibly took part in
the siege of Constantinople; was in an expedition sent
to Egypt for the relief of the sultan Faradj, when he
probably embarked at some port in Cilicia; and in
various expeditions in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>Upon the fall of Bajazet at the battle of Angora,
July 20th, 1402, our runner became the prisoner of
Timour, with whom he remained in Asia Minor; the
Sultan himself being a captive in the camp. The
fable of the iron cage is scarcely worth recalling to
mind; but had there been a shadow of truth in it,
Schiltberger would not have failed to notice the circumstance
of the powerful monarch he had served so
long being thus ignominiously treated.</p>

<p>Schiltberger’s first acquaintance with Armenia and
Georgia was made upon the occasion of Timour’s
invasion of those countries after his conquests in Asia
Minor. Then followed the expedition to Abhase, the
period of rest in the plain of Karabagh, and the return
to Samarkand across the Araxes and through
the kingdoms of Persia.</p>

<p>As the victories of the invincible Timour in India,
Azerbaijan, and Syria, were related to him by his new
comrades, so has Schiltberger recorded them, with some
fresh details on the horrible atrocities committed.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Timour, at Otrar, in 1405, our
author passed into the hands of his son, Shah Rokh,
probably taking part in the expeditions of that monarch
into Mazanderan and the Armenian provinces,
Samarkand, and the territories about the Oxus, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>spending
his winters in the plain of Karabagh, where good
pasturage was to be found; but after the defeat of
Kara Youssouf, Chief of the Turkomans of the Black
Sheep, he remained in the contingent left by Shah
Rokh, at the disposal of his brother, Miran Shah. This
amir was afterwards himself overthrown by Kara
Youssouf, and Schiltberger became subject to Aboubekr,
a son of Shah Rokh, under whom he served for
some time, first at Kars<a name="FNanchor_6_i" id="FNanchor_6_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_i" class="fnanchor">6</a> and then at Erivan, where
he had frequent opportunities for again enjoying the
society of his friends and co-religionists, the Armeno-Catholics,
and perfecting himself in their language.</p>

<p>From Erivan, Schiltberger was dispatched with four
other Christians as part escort to the Tatar prince,
Tchekre, recalled to assume the supreme power in
the Golden Horde. Traversing the provinces on the
western shore of the Caspian Sea, and passing through
Derbent into Great Tatary, they reached a place that
we find named “Origens”, and which Professor Bruun
is at some pains to prove was no other than Anjak,
at one time a port on the Caspian, near Astrahan.
Some curious details are given on the succession to
the Khanate of the Golden Horde, which serve to
authenticate historical accounts, as will be found on
reference to the Notes thereon; and we also read of
the warlike qualities of the Tatars of the Horde, of
their hardy mode of living, eating meat raw and
drinking the blood of their horses, a custom of war
mentioned by Marco Polo.</p>

<p>We now come to what may be considered to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>about the most interesting portion of the travels before
us, viz.: the expedition to Siberia for the purpose of
conquest. The customs, religion, food, mode of travelling,
and clothing of its inhabitants, are so circumstantially
laid before the reader, that it cannot be
doubted Schiltberger saw with his own eyes all he recounts;
he would never otherwise have observed that
there were many wild beasts in the country, the names
of which he could not tell, because they did not exist
in Germany; nor would he have concluded the chapter
in which he speaks of these things, by saying: “All
this I have seen, and was there with the above-named
king’s son, Zeggra.”</p>

<p>In alluding to the sledge-dogs of Great Tatary and
Siberia, Rubruquis, Marco Polo, and Ibn Batouta,
dwell upon their large size. It is not a little remarkable
that Marco Polo, who never saw those animals,
should have heard that they were as big as donkeys;
the very simile employed by Schiltberger. They now
are certainly much inferior in size.</p>

<p>The conquest of Siberia by Ydegou, was followed
by that of Great Bolgara; after which, Tchekre returned
into Great Tatary, and in due course became
ruler of the Horde. Upon his death, the author fell
into the hands of one of his counsellors, named
“Manstzusch”, who, being forced to flee, traversed the
kingdom of Kiptchak, and arrived at Kaffa in the
Crimea. It was when upon this journey that Schiltberger
saw the river Don; the city of Tana, Solkhat
the capital of Kiptchak, and the cities of Kyrkyer
and Sary Kerman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span></p>

<p>In Chapter 37, the author says that he was present
at the marriage festivities of a daughter of the sultan,
Boursbaï, a monarch who ascended the throne in 1422;
and as he did not lose his lord, Tchekre, until about
the year 1424 or 1425, it follows that he must have
gone to Egypt, at least for the second time, subsequently
to the latter date, but by what route and
for what purpose there are no means of determining;
although this was probably the occasion of his passing
the island of Imbros, and touching at the port
of Salonica. During his sojourn in Egypt, the author
was afforded the opportunity of witnessing the reception
of foreign ambassadors at the Court of the
Mamelouk monarch, some portion of the ceremonial
observed upon those occasions reminding us of the
brilliant doings in the palace of the Greek Emperors,
amongst whose earliest predecessors those magnificent
state formalities were introduced by the Romans, who
had themselves adopted them from the Kings of
Persia, after their conquests in the far East.</p>

<p>From Egypt, Schiltberger was sent into Palestine,
when he visited several of the holy places, and to
Arabia, where it may be taken for granted that he assisted
at one of the customary Mahomedan pilgrimages.
Being too devotedly attached to his own Church to entertain
the least sympathy for Islamism, our traveller
is careful to avoid saying anything that might be
construed into a semblance of his having renounced
his religion, under whatsoever circumstances; but that
he must have done so, inevitably, may be accepted as
an unquestionable fact, for where is the page in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
history of Bajazet, of Timour, and of his successors,
that tells of a Christian having been spared persecution,
followed by torture and death? Nor is it credible that
the presence of a slave, professing Christianity, would
have been at all tolerated in the camps of those barbarous
and fanatic rulers. Schiltberger has taken
delight in supplying all the information he was able to
obtain on the forms and solemnities of the Armenian
and Greek Churches, showing at the same time the
respect in which he held Saints in general, by never
failing to relate the miracles attributed to them, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Our superstitions with our life begin;”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but he has equally proved his proficiency in Mahomedanism,
in devoting no less than eleven chapters to an
exposition of its history, doctrines, and legends.</p>

<p>Whether or not Schiltberger traversed the Hyjaz of
Arabia, will possibly remain a controverted point; the
probability is that he did do so, not from the shores of
the Red Sea, but from Syria and Palestine. We find
him describing from personal observation, first, the
pelican, a bird which, according to Buffon, frequents
the borders of Palestine and Arabia, and even the arid
wastes of Arabia and Persia; then the “giant’s shin-bone”,
that spanned a ravine between two mountains
and served as a bridge; an indication that leads Professor
Bruun to the neighbourhood of Kerak and Shaubek, on
the beaten track to the Hyjaz. More than this,
mention is made of the tomb of the prophet at a place
called “Madina”, its situation and ornamentations
being clearly explained; accuracy that is quite ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>ceptional,
as nearly all mediæval notices of the tomb
of Mahomet place it at Mecca. If our author did
indeed travel into Arabia from Palestine, he would
have been the predecessor of Varthema (1503) by that
route, and he is also the first European known to have
visited the holy places of Islam.</p>

<p>Quitting Egypt, Schiltberger returned to the Crimea,
afterwards accompanying his lord, “Manstzusch”, to
the Caucasus, where he found the slave trade in full
swing, a traffic he vigorously condemns by saying of
the people, who sold even their own children, that they
were “bös lüt”. Whilst in Circassia, at that time tributary
to the Golden Horde, the Great Khan required
of its ruler that “Manstzusch” should be expelled his
territory. That prince being thus forced to change his
residence, proceeded to Mingrelia, through Abhase and
Soukhoum its chief town. An unhealthy country,
says our author, when describing the peculiar customs,
dress, and religion of the people.</p>

<p>It is singular that, although Schiltberger notices the
existence of Christians at Samsoun, Joulad, in Georgia,
the Crimea, and other places, he makes no mention of
the large European community at Savastopoli, as Soukhoum
was called by the Genoese, who, especially, were
very numerous, and had had a consul at that port from
the year 1354. That there were many Roman Catholics
at Savastopoli is very certain, for the place was constituted
a bishop’s see, a condition not at all gratifying
to the native population which belonged to the Greek
Church, as would appear from the following circumstance:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span></p>

<p>In 1330, Peter, bishop of Senascopoli (sic) or Savastopoli,
addressed a letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury
and the bishops of England, collectively, in which he
complains of the oppression practised on Christians in
the East, who were carried off into slavery; an infamous
traffic he was unable to suppress because the
local authorities, who belonged to the schismatic Greek
religion, were inimical to him. He entreats the bishops
of England to present the bearer of the letter, one
Joachim of Cremona, to the warriors of England, who
fight for God and aspire to power! That letter is preserved
in the public library at Ratisbon, and can
scarcely be supposed to have reached its destination at
any time.</p>

<p>Being in Mingrelia, Schiltberger was in a Christian
country temptingly situated on the borders of the
Black Sea. It is most likely that he received sufficient
encouragement from the people to induce him to attempt
to regain his liberty, and, at a favourable
moment, he and four of his Christian comrades made
their escape and succeeded in reaching the coast at
Poti,<a name="FNanchor_7_i" id="FNanchor_7_i"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_i" class="fnanchor">7</a> where they had hoped to find some friendly vessel
that would receive them. Failing in this, they rode
along the shore to the hills in Lazistan, and one evening,
after dark, had the good fortune to communicate, by
means of signal fires, with a European ship off the land.
Our traveller and his companions were obliged to prove
their identity by repeating the Pater Noster, Ave
Maria, and Credo, before the boat’s crew could be prevailed
upon to take them off to the ship; and after a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>tedious voyage of many weeks, during which the vessel
was chased by pirates and detained by contrary gales,
and the crew had suffered from want of provisions, Constantinople
was reached. There the runaways were
kindly received and cared for by the emperor (John
VIII. Palæologos), who placed them in charge of the
patriarch, in whose house they lived. Schiltberger is
full of admiration for the great palaces, the church of
St. Sophia, and the magnificent walls of the imperial
city; but not being free to move about as he pleased,
during his long stay in it, the account of Constantinople
and of its marvels is exceedingly meagre, when
compared with the descriptions left by other visitors.
Indeed, what little Schiltberger was able to do in the
way of sight-seeing was effected surreptitiously, with
the connivance of the patriarch’s servants, whom he
accompanied on their errands as opportunities offered.</p>

<p>At the expiration of three months, our author and
his comrades were sent to Kilia at the estuary of the
Danube. Hence Johann Schiltberger easily found his
way to his native country, where he arrived some time
in the year 1427, offering thanks to Almighty God for
his escape “from the Infidel people and their wicked
religion”, and for having preserved him from “the
risk of perdition of body and soul”.</p>

<h2>SCHILTBERGER TO THE READER.</h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I, <span class="smcap">Johanns Schiltberger</span>, left my home near the city of
Munich, situated in Payren, at the time that King Sigmund
of Hungary left for the land of the Infidels. This was,
counting from Christ’s birth, in the thirteen hundred and
ninety-fourth year,<a name="FNanchor_s" id="FNanchor_s"></a><a href="#Footnote_s" class="fnanchor">1</a> with a lord named Leinhart Richartingen.
And I came back again from the land of the Infidels, counting
from Christ’s birth, fourteen hundred and twenty seven.
All that I saw in the land of the Infidels, of wars, and that
was wonderful, also what chief towns and seas I have seen
and visited, you will find described hereafter, perhaps not
quite completely, but I was a prisoner and not independent.
But so far as I was able to understand and to note, so have
I [noted] the countries and cities as they are called in those
countries, and I here make known and publish many interesting
and strange adventures, which are worth listening
to.</p>

<h2>1.—Of the first combat between King Sigmund and
the Turks.</h2>

<p>From the first, King Sigmund appealed in the above-named
year, thirteen hundred and ninety-four, to Christendom
for assistance, at the time that the Infidels were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>doing great injury to Hungern. There came many people from
all countries to help him;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> then he took the people and led
them to the Iron Gate, which separates Ungern from Pulgery
and Walachy, and he crossed the Tunow into Pulgary, and
made for a city called Pudem.<a name="FNanchor_2_1" id="FNanchor_2_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_1" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> It is the capital of Pulgery.
Then came the ruler of the country and of the city, and gave
himself up to the king; then the king took possession of the
city with three hundred men, good horse and foot soldiers,
and then went to another city where were many Turks.
There he remained five days, but the Turks would not give
up the city; but the fighting men expelled them by force,
and delivered the city to the king. Many Turks were killed
and others made prisoners. The king took possession of
this city also, with two hundred men, and continued his
march towards another city called Schiltaw, but called in
the Infidel tongue, Nicopoly.<a name="FNanchor_3_1" id="FNanchor_3_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_1" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> He besieged it by water and
by land for XVI days, then came the Turkish king, called
Wyasit, with two hundred thousand men, to the relief of the
city. When the king, Sigmund, heard this, he went one
mile to meet him with his people, the number of whom were
reckoned at sixteen thousand men. Then came the Duke of
Walachy, called Werterwaywod,<a name="FNanchor_a_1" id="FNanchor_a_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_1" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_4_1" id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_1" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> who asked the king to
allow him to look at the winds.<a name="FNanchor_b_1" id="FNanchor_b_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_1" class="fnanchor">2</a> This the king allowed, and he
took with him one thousand men for the purpose of looking at
the winds, and returned to the king and told him that he
had looked at the winds, and had seen twenty banners, and
that there were ten thousand men under each banner, and
each banner was separate from the other. When the king
heard this, he wanted to arrange the order of battle. The
Duke of Walachy asked that he might be the first to attack,
to which the king would willingly have consented. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>Duke of Burguny heard this, he refused to cede this honour
to any other person, for the just reason that he had come a
great distance with six thousand men,<a name="FNanchor_5_1" id="FNanchor_5_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_1" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> and had expended
much money in the expedition, and he begged the king that
he should be the first to attack. The king asked him to
allow the Ungern to begin, as they had already fought with
the Turks, and knew better than others how they were
armed. This he would not allow to the Ungern, and assembled
his men, attacked the enemy, and fought his way
through two corps; and when he came to the third, he
turned and would have retreated, but found himself surrounded,
and more than half his horsemen were unhorsed,
for the Turks aimed at the horses only, so that he could not
get away, and was taken prisoner. When the king heard
that the Duke of Burgony was forced to surrender, he took
the rest of the people and defeated a body of twelve thousand
foot soldiers that had been sent to oppose him. They were
all trampled upon and destroyed, and in this engagement a
shot killed the horse of my lord Lienhart Richartinger; and
I, Hanns Schiltberger his runner, when I saw this, rode up
to him in the crowd and assisted him to mount my own
horse, and then I mounted another which belonged to the
Turks, and rode back to the other runners. And when all
the [Turkish] foot-soldiers were killed, the king advanced
upon another corps which was of horse. When the Turkish
king saw the king advancing, he was about to fly, but the
Duke of Iriseh, known as the despot,<a name="FNanchor_6_1" id="FNanchor_6_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_1" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> seeing this, went to
the assistance of the Turkish king with fifteen thousand
chosen men and many other bannerets, and the despot threw
himself with his people on the king’s banner and overturned
it; and when the king saw that the banner was
overturned and that he could not remain, he took to flight.<a name="FNanchor_c_1" id="FNanchor_c_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_1" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Then came he of Cily,<a name="FNanchor_d_1" id="FNanchor_d_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_d_1" class="fnanchor">4</a> and Hanns, Burgrave of Nuremberg,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>who took the king and conducted him to a galley on
board of which he went to Constantinoppel. When the
horse and foot soldiers saw that the king had fled, many
escaped to the Tünow and went on board the shipping;
but the vessels were so full that they could not all remain,
and when they tried to get on board they struck them on
the hands, so that they were drowned in the river; many
were killed on the mountain as they were going to the
Tunow. My lord Lienhart Richartinger, Wernher Pentznawer,
Ulrich Kuchler, and little Stainer, all bannerets,
were killed in the fight, also many other brave knights and
soldiers. Of those who could not cross the water and reach
the vessels, a portion were killed; but the larger number
were made prisoners. Among the prisoners were the Duke
of Burgony<a name="FNanchor_7_1" id="FNanchor_7_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_1" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> and
Hanns Putzokardo,<a name="FNanchor_e_1" id="FNanchor_e_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_e_1" class="fnanchor">5</a> and a lord named
Centumaranto.<a name="FNanchor_f_1" id="FNanchor_f_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_f_1" class="fnanchor">6</a> These were two lords of France, and the
Great Count of Hungern. And other mighty lords, horsemen,
and foot-soldiers, were made prisoners, and I also was
made a prisoner.</p>

<h2>2.—How the Turkish king treated the prisoners.</h2>

<p>And now when the King Weyasat had had the battle, he
went near the city where King Sigmund had encamped with
his army, and then went to the battle-field and looked upon
his people that were killed; and when he saw that so many
of his people were killed, he was torn by great grief, and
swore he would not leave their blood unavenged, and ordered
his people to bring every prisoner before him the next day,
by fair means or foul. So they came the next day, each with
as many prisoners as he had made, bound with a cord. I
was one of three bound with the same cord, and was taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>by him who had captured us. When the prisoners were
brought before the king, he took the Duke of Burgony that
he might see his vengeance because of his people that had
been killed. When the Duke of Burgony saw his anger, he
asked him to spare the lives of several he would name;
this was granted by the king. Then he selected twelve
lords, his own countrymen, also Stephen Synüher and the
lord Hannsen of Bodem.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> Then each was ordered to kill his
own prisoners, and for those who did not wish to do so the
king appointed others in their place. Then they took my
companions and cut off their heads, and when it came to
my turn, the king’s son saw me and ordered that I should
be left alive, and I was taken to the other boys, because none
under <span class="smcap lowercase">XX</span> years of age were killed, and I was scarcely
sixteen years old. Then I saw the lord Hannsen Greiff,
who was a noble of Payern, and four others, bound with the
same cord. When he saw the great revenge that was taking
place, he cried with a loud voice and consoled the horse- and
foot-soldiers who were standing there to die. “Stand firm”,
he said, “when our blood this day is spilt for the Christian
faith, and we by God’s help shall become the children of
heaven.” When he said this he knelt, and was beheaded together
with his companions. Blood was spilled from morning
until vespers, and when the king’s counsellors saw that
so much blood was spilled and that still it did not stop, they
rose and fell upon their knees before the king, and entreated
him for the sake of God that he would forget his
rage, that he might not draw down upon himself the vengeance
of God, as enough blood was already spilled. He
consented, and ordered that they should stop, and that the
rest of the people should be brought together, and from
them he took his share and left the rest to his people who
had made them prisoners. I was amongst those the king
took for his share, and the people that were killed on that
day were reckoned at ten thousand men. The prisoners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the king were then sent to Greece to a chief city called
Andranopoli, where we remained prisoners for fifteen days.
Then we were taken by sea to a city called Kalipoli;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> it is
the city where the Turks cross the sea, and there three hundred
of us remained for two months confined in a tower.
The Duke of Burgony also was there in the upper part of
the tower with those prisoners he had saved; and whilst
we were there, the King Sigmund passed us on his way to
Windischy land.<a name="FNanchor_3_2" id="FNanchor_3_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_2" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> When the Turks heard this, they took
us out of the tower and led us to the sea, and one after the
other they abused the king and mocked him, and called to
him to come out of the boat and deliver his people; and this
they did to make fun of him, and skirmished a long time
with each other on the sea. But they did not do him any
harm, and so he went away.</p>

<hr />

<h2>3.—How Wyasit subjugated an entire country.</h2>

<p>On the third day after the Turkish king had killed the
people and sent us prisoners to the above named city, he
marched upon Ungern and crossed the river called the Saw,
at a city called Mittrotz, and took it and all the country
around; and then he went into the Duchy of Petaw, and
took with him from the said country sixteen thousand men
with their wives and children and all their property, and
took the city of the above name and burnt it; and the
people he took away and some he left in Greece.<a name="FNanchor_a_3" id="FNanchor_a_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_3" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> And after
he passed the river called the Saw, he sent orders to Karipoli
that we were to be taken across the sea; and when we
were taken across the sea, we were taken to the king’s capital
called Wursa, where we remained until he himself came.
And when he arrived in the city he took the Duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>Burgony and those the duke had saved, and lodged them
in a house near to his palace. The king then sent a lord
named Hoder of Ungern, with sixty boys, as a mark of
honour to the king-sultan;<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and he would have sent me to
the king-sultan, but I was severely wounded, having three
wounds, so for fear I might die on the way I was left with
the Turkish king. Other prisoners were sent as an offering
to the king of Babilony<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> and the king of Persia,<a name="FNanchor_4_3" id="FNanchor_4_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_3" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> also into
White Tartary,<a name="FNanchor_b_3" id="FNanchor_b_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_3" class="fnanchor">2</a><a name="FNanchor_5_3" id="FNanchor_5_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_3" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> into Greater Armenia,<a name="FNanchor_6_3" id="FNanchor_6_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_3" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> and also into other
countries. I was taken to the palace of the Turkish king;
there for six years I was obliged to run on my feet with
the others, wherever he went, it being the custom that the
lords have people to run before them. After six years I
deserved to be allowed to ride, and I rode six years with
him, so that I was twelve years with him; and it is to be
noted what the said Turkish king did during these twelve
years, all of which is written down piece by piece.</p>

<h2>4.—How Wyasit made war on his brother-in-law,
and killed him.</h2>

<p>From the first he was at war with his brother-in-law, who
was called Caraman, and this name he had because of his
country. The capital of the country is called Karanda,<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> and
because he would not be subject to him, he marched upon him
with one hundred and fifty thousand men. When he knew
that King Weyasit had advanced, he went to meet him with
seventy thousand men, the best he had in the land, and
with whom he intended to resist the king. They met each
other on the plain in front of the city called Konia, which
belonged to the said lord, Caraman. Here they attacked
each other and began to fight, and had on the same day two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>encounters by which one tried to overcome the other, and
both sides had rest at night, that one might not do harm
to the other. That same night Karaman made merry with
trumpets, with drums, and with his guards, with the object
of causing alarm to Weyasit; but Weyasit arranged with
his people that they should not make a fire except for cooking,
and should immediately again put it out. At night he
sent thirty thousand men to the rear of the enemy, and said
to them that when he should attack in the morning they
should also attack. When the day broke, Weyasit went
against the enemy, and the thirty thousand men attacked
in the rear as they were ordered, and when Karaman saw
that the enemy was attacking him in front and behind, he
fled into his city of Konia, and remained in it to defend
himself. Weyasit lay siege to the city for <span class="smcap lowercase">XI</span> days without
being able to take it; then the citizens sent word to
Weyasit that they would surrender the city if he would
secure to them their lives and property. To this he agreed.
Then they sent word to say that they would retire from the
walls when he came to storm, and thus he might take the
city. And this occurred. And when Karaman saw that
Weyasit was entering the city, he attacked him with his
warriors, and fought with him in the town, and if he had
received the least assistance from the inhabitants he would
have forced Weyasit out of the city; but when he saw that he
had no assistance, he fled, but was taken before Weyasit, who
said to him: “Why wilt thou not be subject to me?” Karaman
answered, “Because I am as great a lord as thyself.”
Weyasit became angry, and asked three times if there was
anybody who would rid him of Karaman. At the third time
came one who took him aside and cut off his head and went
back with it to Weyasit, who asked what he had done with
him? He answered, “I have beheaded him.” Then he shed
tears and ordered that another man should do to him what
he did to Karaman, and he was taken to the place where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
beheaded Karaman and he was also beheaded. This was
done because Weyasit thought that nobody should have
killed so mighty a lord, but should have waited until his
lord’s anger had passed away. He then ordered that the
head of Karaman should be fixed on a lance and carried
about the country, so that other cities might submit to him
on hearing that their lord was killed. After this he occupied
the city of Konia with his people and marched upon the city
of Karanda, and called upon them to surrender as he was their
lord, and if they would not do so he would compel them with
the sword. Then the citizens sent out to him four of their
most eminent [fellow citizens], to beg that he would ensure
to them their lives and their property, and begged, as their
lord Karaman was dead, and they had two of his sons in the
city, that he would appoint one of them to be their lord; and
should he do so, they would surrender to him the city. He
replied that he should spare their lives and property, but when
he would have possession of the city, he should know what lord
to appoint, whether the son of Karaman or one of his own
sons. And so they parted. When the citizens heard Weyasit’s
answer they would not give up the city, and said that
although their lord was dead he had left two sons, under
whom they will recover or die. And so they defended themselves
against the king until the fifth day. And as Weyasit
saw that they continued to resist, he sent for more people
and ordered arquebuses to be brought, and platforms to be
constructed. When Karaman’s sons and their mother saw
this, they sent for the chief citizens and said to them: “You
see plainly that we cannot resist Weyasit, who is too powerful
for us; we should be sorry if you died for our sakes,
and we have agreed with our mother that we will trust to
his mercy.” The citizens were pleased at this, and the sons
of Karaman and their mother, and the chief citizens of the
city, opened the gates and went out. And as they were advancing,
the mother took a son in each hand and went up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
to Weyasit, who, when he saw his sister with her sons, went
out of his tent towards her, and when they were near him
they threw themselves at his feet, kissed them, and begged
for mercy, and they gave the keys of the gates and of the
city. When the king saw this, he ordered his lords who
were near him to raise them. When this was done he took
possession of the city, and appointed one of his lords to be
governor, and he sent his sister and her two sons to his
capital called Wurssa.</p>

<h2>5.—How Weyasit drives away the king of Sebast.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></h2>

<p>There was a vassal named Mirachamad who resided in a
city called Marsüany; it was on the border of Karaman’s
country. When Mirachamad heard that King Weyasit had
conquered Karaman’s country, he sent to him to ask him to
drive away also the king of Sebast, who was called Wurthanadin,
who had seized upon his territory because he
could not himself expel him, and he should give him the
territory in exchange for one in his own country. Weyasit
sent to his assistance his son Machamet with thirty thousand
men, and they forcibly expelled the king called Wurthanadin
out of the country.<a name="FNanchor_a_5" id="FNanchor_a_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_5" class="fnanchor">1</a> Then Mirachamad bestowed
upon Machamet<a name="FNanchor_b_5" id="FNanchor_b_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_5" class="fnanchor">2</a> the capital and all the territory, because
his first engagement had been in its behalf. Then Weyasit
took Mirachamad with him to his own country, and gave
him another territory for his own.</p>

<h2>6.—What sixty of us Christians had agreed upon.</h2>

<p>And when Weyasit came to his capital, there were sixty
of us Christians agreed that we should escape, and made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>bond between ourselves and swore to each other that we
should die or succeed together; and each of us took time to
get ready, and at the time we met together, and chose two
leaders from amongst ourselves by lot, and whatever they
ordered we were to obey. Then we rose after midnight and
rode to a mountain and came to it by daybreak. And when
we came to the mountain we dismounted, and let our horses
rest until sunrise, when we remounted and rode the same
day and night. And when Weyasit heard that we had taken
to flight, he sent five hundred horse with orders that we
were to be found, that we were to be caught, and brought
to him. They overtook us near a defile, and called to us to
give ourselves up. This we would not do, and we dismounted
from our horses and defended ourselves against
them as well as we could. When their commander saw that
we defended ourselves, he came forward and asked for peace
for one hour. We consented. He came to us and asked us
to give ourselves up as prisoners; he would answer for the
safety of our lives. We said we would consult, and did
consult, and gave him this answer: We knew that so soon as
we were made prisoners, we should die so soon as we came
before the king, and it would be better that we should die
here, with arms in our hands, for the Christian faith. When
the commander saw that we were determined, he again
asked that we should give ourselves as prisoners, and promised
on his oath that he would ensure our lives, and if the
king was so angry as to want to kill us, he would let them
kill him first. He promised this on his oath, and therefore
we gave ourselves up as prisoners. He took us before
the king, who ordered that we should be killed immediately;
the commander went and knelt before the king, and said
that he had trusted in his mercy and had promised us our
lives, and asked him also that he should spare us because he
had even sworn that such would be the case. The king
then asked him if we had done any harm? He said: No.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Then he ordered that we should be put into prison; there
we remained for nine months as prisoners, during which time
twelve of us died. And when it was the Easter-day of the
Infidels, his eldest son Wirmirsiana,<a name="FNanchor_a_6" id="FNanchor_a_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_6" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> begged for us, then
he set us free, and ordered that we should be brought to him;
then we were obliged to promise him that we should never
try to escape again, and he gave us back our horses and
increased our pay.</p>

<h2>7.—How Wyasit took the city of Samson.<a name="FNanchor_1_7" id="FNanchor_1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_7" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></h2>

<p>Afterwards, in the summer, Wyasit took eighty thousand
men into a country called Genyck, and lay siege to a capital
called Samson. This city was built by the strong man
Samson, from whom it has its name. The lord of the
country was of the same name as the country, Zymayd, and
the king expelled the lord out of the land; and when it was
heard in the city that their lord was driven away, the people
gave themselves up to Weyasit, who occupied the city and
all the country with his people.</p>

<hr />

<h2>8.—Of serpents and vipers.</h2>

<p>A great miracle is to be noted which took place near the
said city of Samson, during the time that I was with Weyasit.
There came around the city such a lot of vipers and serpents,
that they took up the space of a mile all round. There is a
country called Tcyenick which belongs to Sampson; it is a
wooded country in which are many forests. One part of the
vipers came from the said forests, and one part came out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>the sea. The vipers remained for <span class="smcap lowercase">xi</span> days, and then they
fought with each other, and nobody dared to leave the
city on account of the vipers, although they did no harm
either to men or to cattle. Then the lord of the city and of
the country gave orders that likewise no harm should be done
to these reptiles, and said it was a sign and a manifestation
from Almighty God. And now on the tenth day, the serpents
and vipers fought with each other from morning until
the going down of the sun, and when the lord and the
people of the city saw what was done, the lord caused the
gate to be opened, and rode out with a few people out of the
city, and looked where the vipers were fighting, and saw
that the vipers from the sea had to succumb to those of the
forests. And the next morning early, the lord again rode
out of the city to see if the reptiles were still there; he found
none but dead vipers, which he ordered to be collected and
counted. There were eight thousand. He then ordered a
pit to be made, and ordered all to be thrown in and covered
with earth, and he sent to Weyasit, who at that time was
lord in Turkey, to tell him of the marvel. He took it for a
piece of luck, as he had only just taken the city and country
of Samson, and almost rejoiced that the forest adders had
succumbed to the sea adders, and said it was a manifestation
from Almighty God, and he hoped that as he was a
powerful lord and king of the sea-board, so he would also,
by the help of God the Almighty, become the powerful lord
and king of the sea. Samson consists of two cities opposite
to each other, and their walls are distant, one from the other,
an arrow’s flight. In one of these cities there are Christians,
and at that time the Italians of Genoa<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> possessed it. In
the other are Infidels to whom the country belongs. At
that time the lord of the city and country was a duke called
Schuffmanes, son of [the duke of] Middle Pulgrey, the chief
city of which country is Ternowa,<a name="FNanchor_2_8" id="FNanchor_2_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_8" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and who at that time
had three hundred fortified towns, cities, and castles. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
country was conquered by Weyasit who took the duke and
his son. The father died in prison, and the son became converted
to the faith of the Infidels, so that his life might be
spared. Weyasit conquered Samson and the country, and
conquered Zyenick; and the city and the country he gave
to him for his lifetime, in place of his fatherland.</p>

<h2>9.—How the Infidels remain in the fields with their
cattle, in winter and summer.</h2>

<p>It is the custom among the Infidels for some lords to lead
a wandering life with their cattle, and when they come to a
country that has good pasturage, they rent it of the lord of
the country for a time. There was a Turkish lord called
Otman, who wandered about with his cattle, and in the
summer came to a country called Tamast, and the capital of
the country is also so called. He asked the king of Tamast,
who was called Wurchanadin,<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> that he would lend him a
pasturage where he and his cattle might feed during the
summer. The king lent him such a pasturage, to which he
went with his dependants and cattle, and remained there the
summer; and in autumn he broke up and returned to his
country, without the king’s permission and knowledge; and
when the king heard of this he became very angry, and took
one thousand men with him and went to the pasturage that
Otman had occupied, and encamped there, and sent four
thousand horsemen after Otman, and ordered that they
should bring back Otman alive, with all his belongings.
And when Otman heard that the king had sent after him,
he hid himself in a mountain, so that those who rode after
him could not find him; and they encamped on a meadow
in front of the mountain where Otman was with his people,
and remained there that night without troubling themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
about him. And when the day dawned, Otman took one
thousand of his best horsemen to look at the winds, and
when he saw that they were not on their guard, and were
without care, he rode towards them and suddenly took them
by surprise, so that they could not defend themselves, and
many of them were killed; the others took to flight. The
king was told how Otman had annihilated his expedition,
but he would not believe it, and thought that fun was being
made of him, until some of them came running to him.
Even then he would not believe it, and sent one hundred
horsemen to see if such was the case; and when the hundred
horsemen went to see about it, Otman was on his way
with his people to attack the king; and when he saw the
hundred horsemen he overtook them, and came with them
into the camp. And when the king and his people saw that
they were overtaken, and that they could not defend themselves
any more, they took to flight. The king himself had
scarcely time to mount his horse, and took to flight to a
mountain; but one of Otman’s servants saw him, and hastened
after him on the mountain; then the king could fly no farther,
and the soldier called upon him to surrender; but he would
not give himself up. Then he took his bow and would have
shot him, when the king made himself known and asked
him to let him go, promising to give him a fine castle, and
he wanted to give him the ring he had on his hand as a
pledge. The soldier would not do so, and made him a
prisoner and brought him to his lord. And Otman pursued
the people all day until the evening, and killed many of
them, and encamped where the king had stayed, and sent
for the people and cattle that he had left to run about the
mountains. And when the people came with the cattle, he
took the king, and went to the capital called Tamastk,
where he encamped with all his people, and sent word into
the city that he had captured the king, and that if they
would deliver to him the city, he would give peace and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
security. The city made this answer: If he had their king,
they had his son, and they had lords enough, as he was too
weak to be a lord. He then said to the king, that if he
wanted his life to be spared, he should speak to the citizens
that they give up the city. So they took him before the
city, and he asked the citizens that they should deliver him
from death, and give up the city to Otman. They replied:
We will not give up the city to Otman, because he is too
feeble a lord for us; and if thou shouldst no longer care to
be our lord, we have thy son, whom we will have for our
lord. When Otman heard this, he was angry, and seeing
his anger, the king begged him to spare his life, promising
to give him the city of Gaissaria, with all its dependancies.
This Otman would not do, and he ordered the king to be
beheaded in sight of the people of the city, and ordered that
afterwards he should be quartered, each part being fixed
on a stake stuck in the ground in sight of the city, and the
head on the point of a lance, together with the four quarters.
And whilst the king lay before the city, the king’s son sent
to his father-in-law, the powerful ruler of White Tartary,
that he should come to his assistance, because Otman had
killed his father and many others, and that he was before
the city. And so soon as his father-in-law heard this, he
took with him all his people, with their wives, children, and
all their cattle, as is the custom of the country, because he
intended going to Tamast to deliver the country from Otman,
and his people were numbered at forty thousand men,
without including women and children. When Otman heard
that the Tartar king was approaching, he went with his
people to the mountains, where he encamped. The Tartar
king encamped before the city, and so soon as Otman heard
of it, he took fifteen hundred men and divided them into
two parts, and when night came he marched upon them on
both sides with loud cries. When the Tartar king heard of
this, he thought they wanted to betray him, and fled into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the city, which, when his people heard, they also took to
flight. Otman pursued them and killed a great many, and
captured much booty. They returned to their country, and
Otman took with him to the mountain where he had left his
cattle, the cattle and the booty that he had taken from
them. Before it was day, the Tartar king rode after his
people to make them turn back; this they would not do, so
he turned back again. Then Otman again lay siege to the
city, and invited them to give him the city, and he would
do as he had promised. This they would not do, and sent
to beg Weyasit to come and drive Otman out of the country,
and they would surrender the city to him. Weyasit sent his
eldest son, with twenty thousand horsemen and four thousand
foot-soldiers, to the help of the town; and I also was
in this expedition. And when he heard that the son of
Weyasit was coming, he sent his property and cattle to the
mountain where he had been, and he himself remained in
the plain with one thousand horsemen. Then the king’s
son sent two thousand horsemen to see if they could find
Otman; and when they saw Otman, they attacked each
other. And when they saw that they could not overcome
him, they sent for assistance. Then came Weyasit’s son,
with all his people. But when Otman saw him, he rode
against him, and would quickly have put him to flight, for
the people were not close together. The king’s son cried
to his people, and they began to fight, and they fought for
three hours consecutively. And when they were fighting
with each other, four thousand foot-soldiers attacked the
tent of Otman, and when he heard this, he sent four hundred
horsemen, who, with the assistance of those who kept the
goods and cattle, expelled the foot-soldiers out of the tent.
Otman went with a force into the mountain, where his property
was, and sent it away, and remained during that time
before the mountain. Then the king’s son appeared before
the city, and the citizens opened the gates of Damastchk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and rode out and asked him to take the city. This he would
not do, and sent to his father, that he should come and take
the city and territory. He came with one hundred and fifty
thousand men, took the city and country, and gave them to
his son Machmet, and not to him who had expelled Otman
from being king of the city and country.<a name="FNanchor_2_9" id="FNanchor_2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_9" class="fnanchor">(2)</a></p>

<hr />

<h2>10.—How Weyasit took a country that belonged to
the Sultan.</h2>

<p>After Weyasit had installed his son in the kingdom, he
sent to the king-sultan in respect to a city called Malathea,<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
and the country that belonged to the city, because
the city and the country belonged to the above-named
kingdom which was in the possession of the king-sultan,
and therefore required that he should surrender the city of
Malathea and the territory, because he had conquered the
kingdom. The king-sultan sent word to him that he had
won the kingdom by the sword, and he who wished to have
it must also win it by the sword. When Weyasit received
this answer, he went into the country with two hundred
thousand men, and lay siege to the city for two months;
and when he found that it would not surrender, he filled up
the ditches and surrounded the city with his people, and
began to storm. When they saw this they asked for mercy,
and gave themselves up. Then he took the city and the
country, and occupied it.</p>

<p>At about the same time, the White Tartars besieged the
city called Angarus, which belonged to Weyasit; and when
he heard of this, he sent to its assistance his eldest son
with thirty-two thousand men. He fought a battle, but he
was obliged to return to Wyasit, who ordered more men,
and sent him back again. But he fought with him, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the Tartar lord and two vassals, and brought them as prisoners
to Weyasit, and thus the White Tartars gave themselves
up to Weyasit. He put another lord over them, took
the three lords to his capital, and then marched against
another city called Adalia,<a name="FNanchor_a_10" id="FNanchor_a_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_10" class="fnanchor">1</a>
which belonged to the sultan,
and the city is not far from Zypern; and in the country to
which the city belongs, there are no other cattle but camels.
After Weyasit took the city and the country, the country
made him a present of ten thousand camels; and after he
occupied the city and the country, he took the camels into
his own country.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_10" id="Footnote_a_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_10"><span class="label">1</span></a>Adalia or Satalia, on the sea-shore. William of Tyre so called the
chief city of Pamphylia. The town lies, as correctly stated, opposite to
Cyprus. <i>N.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<h2>11.—Of the King-Sultan.</h2>

<p>About this time died the king-sultan, named Warchhoch,
and his son named Joseph became king; but one of
his father’s dependants went to war with him for the kingdom.
Then Joseph sent to Weyasit, and became reconciled
with him, and asked him that he should come to help him.
So he sent twenty thousand men to help him, in which expedition
I was also. Thus Joseph expelled his rival, and
became a powerful king.<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> After this it was told him, that
five hundred of his dependants were against him, and were
in favour of his rival. He ordered that they should be
taken to a plain, where they were all cut into two parts.
Afterwards, we again returned to our lord, Weyasit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<h2>12.—How Temerlin conquered the kingdom of
Sebast.</h2>

<p>When Weyasit had expelled Otman from Tamast, as has
already been stated, he went to his lord named Tämerlin,
to whom he was subject, and complained of Weyasit, how
he had driven him away from the kingdom of Tamask,
which he had conquered, and at the same time asked him
to help him to reconquer his kingdom. Tämerlin said that
he would send to Weyasit, to restore the country. This he
did, but Weyasit sent word that he would not give it up,
for as he had won it by the sword, it might as well be his
as another’s. So soon as Tämerlin heard this, he assembled
ten hundred thousand men, and conducted them into the
kingdom of Sebast, and lay siege to the capital, before
which he remained <span class="smcap">XXI</span> days, and he undermined the walls
of the city in several places, and took the city by force,
although there were in it five thousand horsemen sent by
Weyasit.<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> They were all buried alive in this way. When
Tämerlin took the city, the governor begged that he would
not shed their blood. To this he consented, and so they
were buried alive. Then he levelled the city, and carried
away the inhabitants into captivity in his own country.
There were also nine thousand virgins taken into captivity
by Tämerlin to his own country.<a name="FNanchor_2_12" id="FNanchor_2_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_12" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Before he took the
city, he had at least three thousand men killed. Then he
returned to his own country.</p>

<hr />

<h2>13.—Weyasit conquers Lesser Armenia.</h2>

<p>Scarcely had Tämerlin returned to his own country,<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
than Weyasit assembled three hundred thousand men, and
went into Lesser Ermenia and took it from Tämerlin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
took the capital called Ersingen, together with its lord
who was named Tarathan,<a name="FNanchor_2_13" id="FNanchor_2_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_13" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and then went back to his
own country. So soon as Tämerlin heard that Weyasit
had conquered the said country, he went to meet him with
sixteen hundred thousand men; and when Weyasit heard
this, he went to meet him with fourteen hundred thousand
men. They met near a city called Augury, where they
fought desperately. Weyasit had quite thirty thousand
men of White Tartary, whom he placed in the van at the
battle. They went over to Tämerlin; then they had two
encounters, but neither could overcome the other. Now
Tämerlin had thirty-two trained elephants at the battle,
and ordered, after mid-day, that they should be brought
into the battle. This was done, and they attacked each
other; but Weyasit took to flight, and went with at least
one thousand horsemen to a mountain. Tämerlin surrounded
the mountain so that he could not move, and took
him.<a name="FNanchor_a_13" id="FNanchor_a_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_13" class="fnanchor">1</a>
 Then he remained eight months in the country,
conquered more territory and occupied it, and then went to
Weyasit’s capital and took him with him, and took his
treasure, and silver and gold, as much as one thousand
camels could carry; and he would have taken him into his
own country, but he died<a name="FNanchor_b_13" id="FNanchor_b_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_13" class="fnanchor">2</a>
on the way<a name="FNanchor_c_13" id="FNanchor_c_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_13" class="fnanchor">3</a>
<a name="FNanchor_3_13" id="FNanchor_3_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_13" class="fnanchor">(3)</a>. And so I
became Tämerlin’s prisoner, and was taken by him to his
country. After this I rode after him. What I have described
took place during the time that I was with Weyasit.</p>

<h2>14.—How Tämerlin goes to war with the King-Sultan.</h2>

<p>After Tämerlin had overcome Weyasit and returned to
his own country, he went to war with the king-sultan, who
is the chief king among Infidels. He took with him <span class="smcap">XII</span> hundred
thousand men, went into his territory, and lay siege to
a city called Hallapp, which contains four hundred thousand
houses. Then the lord and governor of the city took with
him eighty thousand men, and went out and fought with
Tämerlin, but he could not overcome him, and fled again into
the city, and many people were killed in his flight. He
continued to defend himself, but Tämerlin took a suburb on
the fourth day, and the people he found in it he threw into
the moat of the city, put timber and mire upon them, and
filled the moat in four places. The moat was twelve fathom
deep, and [cut] in the solid rock. Then he stormed the city,
and took it by assault and captured the governor, and fully
occupied the city, and then went to another city called
Hrumkula, which surrendered. Then he went to another
city called Anthap. There he lay siege for <span class="smcap">VIIII</span> days, and
took it on the tenth day by assault, and pillaged it, and went
to another city called Wehessum. There he lay siege for
<span class="smcap">XV</span> days. After that they gave themselves up and he occupied
it. The cities I have named are chief cities in Syria.<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
Then he went to another city called Damaschk; it is the
principal capital in the country. When the king-sultan
heard that he was laying siege to Tamasch, he sent and
begged that he would not injure the city, and spare the
temple. To this he consented, and went further on. The
temple in the city of Tamasch is so large, that it has externally
forty gates. Inside the temple hang twelve thousand
lamps, of which number <span class="smcap">IX</span> thousand are lit daily. But every
week, on Friday, all of them are lit. Amongst these lamps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
are many in gold and silver, made by the order of kings and
great lords. So soon as Tämerlin had gone out from the
city, the king-sultan left his capital Alchei Terchei, with
thirty thousand men, hoping to arrive before Tämerlin took
it, and he sent twelve thousand men to Tamaschen. When
Tämerlin heard this, he marched towards him, and the king-sultan
returned again to his capital. Tämerlin pursued him,
and where the king-sultan passed the night, there in the
morning he caused the water and the grass to be poisoned;
and wherever Tämerlin came, he suffered great losses
amongst his people and cattle, and could not overtake him.
Then he turned again against Tamaschen and besieged it for
<span class="smcap">III</span> months, but could not take it. During those three
months they fought every day, and when the twelve M men
saw that they had no assistance from their lord, they asked
Tämerlin to be allowed to pass. He consented, and they
left the city at night and returned to their lord. Then Tämerlin
stormed the city and took it by assault. And now,
soon after he had taken the city, came to him the Geit, that
is as much as to say a bishop, and fell at his feet, and begged
mercy for himself and his priests. Tämerlin ordered
that he should go with his priests into the temple; so the
priests took their wives, their children and many others, into
the temple for protection, until there were thirty thousand
young and old. Now Tämerlin gave orders that when the
temple was full, the people inside should be shut up in it.
This was done. Then wood was placed around the temple,
and he ordered it to be ignited, and they all perished in the
temple. Then he ordered that each one of his [soldiers]
should bring to him the head of a man. This was done,
and it took three days; then with these heads were constructed
three towers, and the city was pillaged.<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> After this
he went into another country called Scherch,<a name="FNanchor_3_14" id="FNanchor_3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_14" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> a country
where no cattle are bred, and this country gave itself up.
He ordered them to bring food for his people who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
famished, although they had been before a city so rich in
spices. Then he returned to his country, having left that
country and occupied the cities.</p>

<hr />

<h2>15.—How Tämerlin conquered Babiloni.</h2>

<p>Now when he returned from the land of the king-sultan,
he took ten hundred thousand men with him and marched
upon Babiloni. When the king<a name="FNanchor_a_15" id="FNanchor_a_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_15" class="fnanchor">1</a> heard this, he left a garrison
in the city and went out of it. Tämerlin besieged it
for a whole month, during which time he undermined the
walls, took the city and burnt it. Then he had the earth
ploughed and barley planted there, because he had sworn
that he would destroy the city, so that nobody should know
whether there had been houses or no. Then he went to a
fortress; it stood in a river, and the king kept his treasure
there.<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> He could not take this fortress, across the water,
so he turned away the water, and found under the water
three leaden chests full of gold and silver; each chest was
two fathoms long, and one fathom broad. The king sank
them here, so that if the fortress was taken, the gold would
remain. The chests he removed, and he took the fortress
and found fifteen men in it. They were hanged. They
also found in the fortress four chests full of silver and gold,
which he also took away, and then conquered three cities.
Then summer began, so that on account of the heat he could
not remain in the country.</p>

<h2>16.—How Tämerlin conquered Lesser India.<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></h2>

<p>When Tämerlin returned home from Babiloni, he sent
word to all in his land that they were to be ready in four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>months, as he wanted to go into Lesser India, distant from
his capital a four months’ journey. When the time came,
he went into Lesser India with four hundred thousand men,
and crossed a desert of twenty days’ journey; there, is a great
want of water, and then he got to a mountain which it took
him eight days, before he came out of it. On this mountain
there is a path, where camels and horses must be bound to
planks and lowered. Then he came to a valley where it is
so dark, that people cannot see each other by the light of
day, and it is of half a day’s journey.<a name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Then he came to
a high mountainous country, in which he travelled for three
days and three nights, and then got to a beautiful plain,
where lies the capital of the country. He stopped with his
people in the plain, near the wooded mountain, and sent
word to the king of the country: Mirttemirgilden, that is
as much as to say, Give up thyself, the lord Tämerlin is
come.<a name="FNanchor_3_16" id="FNanchor_3_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_16" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> When the king received the message, he sent
word to tell him that he would settle with him with the
sword. Then he marched against Tämerlin with four hundred
thousand men, and with four hundred elephants trained
for war; upon each elephant was a turret, in each of which
were at least ten armed men. When Tämerlin heard of this,
he advanced with his people to meet him; in the mean time
the king placed the elephants in the front, and when they
engaged, Tämerlin might easily have conquered; but he
could not overcome the king, because his horses were afraid
of the elephants and would not advance. This went on from
morning until mid-day, so that Tämerlin retired and had his
counsellors to consult, how the king and his elephants were
to be overcome? One named Suleymanschach advised,
that camels should be taken and wood fastened on them,
and when the elephants advanced, the wood should be ignited,
and the camels driven up against the elephants; thus
would they be subdued by the fire and the cries of the
camels, because the elephants are afraid of fire. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Tämerlin took twenty thousand camels and prepared them
as above described, and the king came with his elephants
in front. Tämerlin went to meet him, and drove the camels
up against the elephants, the wood on them being on fire.
The camels cried out, and when the elephants saw the fire
and heard the great cries, they took to flight, so that none
could hold them. When Tämerlin saw this, he pursued
them with all his force, and of the elephants many were
killed.<a name="FNanchor_4_16" id="FNanchor_4_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_16" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> When the king saw this, he went back into his
capital. Tämerlin followed him up and besieged the city
for ten days. In the mean time the king agreed with him,
to give him two zentner of gold of India, which is better
than the gold of Arabia, and he also gave him many precious
stones, and promised to lend him thirty thousand men
whenever he might want them; and so they were reconciled
with each other. The king remained in his kingdom, and
Tämerlin returned to his country, and took with him one
hundred elephants and the riches the king had given him.</p>

<hr />

<h2>17.—How a vassal carried off riches that belonged to
Tämerlin.</h2>

<p>When Tämerlin returned from Lesser India, he sent one
of his vassals named Chebakh, with ten thousand men, to the
city of Soltania,<a name="FNanchor_a_17" id="FNanchor_a_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_17" class="fnanchor">1</a>
<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> to bring to him the five-yearly tribute
of Persia and Ermenia which was kept in that city. He
came, and took the tribute, and loaded one thousand waggons,
and then he wrote to a lord in the country of Massan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>der,
who was his friend. He came with fifty thousand men,
they made an alliance with each other, and the treasure was
taken to Massenderam. When Tämerlin heard of this, he
sent a great many people to conquer the above-named country,
and bring to him the two lords as prisoners. When the
people got to the country, they could not do any harm because
of the large forests which surround it, and they sent
to Tämerlin for more people. He sent other seventy thousand
men to clear the woods and make a road. They did
so for ten miles, but could not conquer the territory. They
sent to tell Tämerlin, and he ordered them to go home,
which they did, without having done anything.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_17" id="Footnote_a_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_17"><span class="label">1</span></a>Sultania, to the north of Kaswin. The construction of this city
was begun by Ilchan, or by Argun the Persian viceroy, and completed
by Chasan. These powerful despots of Persia wanted to acquire, as is
not rarely the case with other despots, immortal fame for themselves,
by extorting from their subjects for the purpose of constructing magnificent
buildings. Their wishes have not been realised. <i>N.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<h2>18.—How Tämerlin caused <span class="smcap">MMM</span> children to be
killed.</h2>

<p>Then he went into a kingdom called Hisspahan and made
for the capital, Hisspahan, and required it to surrender.
They gave themselves up, and went to him with their wives
and children. He received them graciously, occupied the
city with six thousand of his people, and took away with
him the lord of the city, whose name was Schachister. And
so soon as the city heard that Tämerlin was gone out of the
country, they closed all the gates and killed the six thousand
men. When Tämerlin knew this, he returned to the city
and besieged it for <span class="smcap">XV</span> days, but he could not take it,
and made peace with them on condition that they should
lend him the archers that were in the city, for an expedition;
after that, he should send them back. They sent to him
twelve thousand archers; he cut off all their thumbs, and
forced them back into the city and himself entered it. He
assembled all the citizens, and ordered all those over fourteen
years to be beheaded, and the boys under <span class="smcap">XIIII</span> years he
ordered to be spared, and with the heads was constructed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
tower in the centre of the city; then he ordered the women
and children to be taken to a plain outside the city, and
ordered the children under seven years of age to be placed
apart, and ordered his people to ride over these same
children. When his counsellors and the mothers of the
children saw this, they fell at his feet, and begged that he
would not kill them. He would not listen, and ordered that
they should be ridden over; but none would be the first to
do so. He got angry, and rode himself [amongst them] and
said: “Now I should like to see who will not ride after me?”
Then they were all obliged to ride over the children, and
they were all trampled upon.<a name="FNanchor_1_18" id="FNanchor_1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_18" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> There were seven thousand.
Then he set fire to the city, and took the other
women and children into his own city; and then went to
his capital called Semerchant, where he had not been for
twelve years.</p>

<hr />

<h2>19.—Tämerlin wants to go to war with the Great
Chan.</h2>

<p>At about this time, the great Chan, king of Chetey, sent
an ambassador with four hundred horsemen, to demand of
him the tribute which he had forgotten, and kept for five
years. Tämerlin took the ambassador with him, until he
came to his above-named capital, and sent him from there to
tell his lord, that he would neither pay tribute nor be subject
to him, and that he should himself pay him a visit. Then
he sent messengers all over his country that they should
prepare, as he wished to advance on Cetey, and taking
eighteen hundred thousand men, he marched for a whole
month. He then came to a desert that was seventy days
journey across; there he travelled ten days, and lost many
people there for want of water. Great harm also befel his
horses and other cattle, because it was very cold in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>country;<a name="FNanchor_1_19" id="FNanchor_1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_19" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> and when he perceived his great losses amongst
his people and cattle, he turned and went back to his capital
and fell ill.</p>

<hr />

<h2>20.—-Of Tämerlin’s death.</h2>

<p>It is to be noted, that three causes made Tämerlin fret, so
that he became ill, and died of that same illness. The first
cause was grief that his vassal had escaped with the tribute;
the other it is to be noted was, that Tämerlin had three
wives, and that the youngest, whom he loved very much, had
been intimate with one of his vassals whilst he was away.
When Tämerlin came home, his eldest wife told him that
his youngest wife had cared for one of his vassals, and had
broken her vow. He would not believe it. She came to
him and said: “Come to her and order her to open her trunk:
you will find a ring with a precious stone, and a letter which
he has sent to her.” Tämerlin sent to tell her that he would
pass the night with her, and when he came into her room,
he told her to open her trunk. This was done, and he found
the ring and the letter. He sat down near her, and asked
whence the ring and letter had come to her? She fell
at his feet, and begged he would not be angry, because one
of his vassals had sent them to her without any right.<a name="FNanchor_a_20" id="FNanchor_a_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_20" class="fnanchor">1</a>
After this he went out of the room, and ordered that she
should be immediately beheaded. This was done. He then
sent five thousand horsemen after this same vassal, that they
might bring him as a prisoner; but he was warned by the
commander who was sent after him, and the vassal took
with him five hundred men, his wife and children, and fled
to the country of Wassandaran. There Tämerlin could not
get at him. It fretted him so much that he had killed his
wife, and that the vassal had escaped, that he died, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>buried in the country with great magnificence. Be it also
known that, after he was buried, the priests that belong to
the temple, heard him howl every night during a whole year.
His friends gave large alms, that he should cease his howlings.
But this was of no use. They asked advice of their
priests, and went to his son and begged that he would set
free the prisoners taken by his father in other countries,
and especially those that were in his capital, who were all
craftsmen he had brought to his capital, where they had to
work. He let them go, and so soon as they were free,
Tämerlin did not howl any more. All that is written above,
happened during the six years that I was with Tämerlin,<a name="FNanchor_b_20" id="FNanchor_b_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_20" class="fnanchor">2</a>
and I also was present.</p>

<hr />

<h2>21.—-Of the sons of Tämerlin.</h2>

<p>You should know that Tämerlin left two sons. The
eldest was named Scharoch, who had a son to whom Tämerlin
gave his capital and the country that belonged to
it, and to each of his two sons, Scharoch and Miraschach,
he gave a kingdom in Persia, and other large territories
that belonged to them. After the death of Tämerlin, I
came to his son named Scharoch, who had the kingdom of
Horossen, the capital of which is called Herren. Here
Schiltberger remained with Miraschach, the son of Tämerlin.</p>

<p>The younger son of Tämerlin had in Persia a kingdom
called Thaures, and after his father’s death came a vassal
named Joseph, who expelled Miraschach from his kingdom.
He sent to his brother Scharoch, and asked him to help him
to recover his kingdom. His brother came with eighty
thousand men, and sent thirty thousand men to his brother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>that he might expel the vassal, and kept to himself forty-two
thousand men. With these he marched against Joseph,
who, on learning this, went to meet him with sixty thousand
men, and they fought a whole day, without either the
one or the other being overcome. Then Mirenschach asked
his brother, Scharoch, to come with the rest of his people,
He came. Then he fought with Joseph and drove him
away, and Mirenschach returned to his kingdom. There
were also two countries that were subdued by Joseph; the
one was called Churten,<a name="FNanchor_a_21" id="FNanchor_a_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_21" class="fnanchor">1</a> the other was Lesser Armeny.
Scharoch went into these countries and conquered them,
and bestowed them on his brother, and then returned into
his own country, leaving, for the assistance of his brother,
twenty thousand men from amongst his people, with whom
I also remained.<a name="FNanchor_1_21" id="FNanchor_1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_21" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></p>

<hr />

<h2>22.—How Joseph caused Mirenschach to be beheaded,
and took possession of all his territory.</h2>

<p>After Mirenschach had remained in peace for one year,
Joseph entered his country with a large number of people,
which, when he perceived, he went to meet him with fully
four hundred thousand men. They met each other at a
plain called Scharabach,<a name="FNanchor_a_22" id="FNanchor_a_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_22" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> and fought together for two
days. Mirenschach was overcome and made a prisoner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Soon afterwards, Joseph ordered he should be beheaded.
It is to be noted why Joseph killed Mirenschach. Joseph
had a brother named Miseri, who killed a brother of
Mirenschach, called Zychanger. When they met in a battle,
Mirenshach took Miseri and killed him in prison, so that
Mirenschach also was put to death;<a name="FNanchor_2_22" id="FNanchor_2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_22" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and Joseph had
Mirenschach’s head stuck on a spear, and taken to the city
called Thaures after the kingdom, and showed it there,
that they might give themselves up the sooner. When
they saw that their lord was dead, they gave themselves
up; and then he took the city and the whole kingdom
with all its dependencies.</p>

<h2>23.—How Joseph vanquished a king and beheaded
him.</h2>

<p>And now when Joseph had taken the kingdom, the king
of Babilonie sent to him that he should give up the kingdom,
as it belonged to his own kingdom, and his residence
was in it; and because it was not right that he should keep
the kingdom, as he was not noble and would be a bad
vassal. Joseph sent back word that there must be a ruler
in the kingdom, and that he should confirm it to him, and
sent to say that he would mint in his name, and observe all
that was due to him. The king would not do so, because
he had a son to whom he wished to give the kingdom; and
he attacked Joseph with fifty thousand men. Joseph went
to meet him with sixty thousand men, and they fought with
each other at a plain called Achtum.<a name="FNanchor_a_23" id="FNanchor_a_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_23" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_23" id="FNanchor_1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_23" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> The king fled to
a city near the plain. Joseph followed, and took the king
and beheaded him, and occupied the kingdom as before.</p>

<h2>24.—How Schiltberger came to Aububachir.</h2>

<p>And after that Miraschach, Tämerlin’s son, was taken
in battle and beheaded, I came to his son Aububachir, with
whom I remained four years. And after the king of Babiloni
was also killed by Joseph, as is already written,
Abubachir took a country called Kray; it belonged to the
kingdom of Babiloni. Aububachir had also a brother called
Mansur,<a name="FNanchor_1_24" id="FNanchor_1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_24" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> who had a country called Erban. He sent [word]
that he should come to him. This, Mansur would not do; so
he went and took him, put him into prison and strangled
him, and took his country. It is also to be noted, that Abubachir
was so strong, that he shot through a ploughshare with
an Infidel bow; the iron went through, and the shaft remained
in the ploughshare. This ploughshare was sent as
a marvel to Tämerlin’s capital, called Samerchant, and
fixed to the gate. When the king-sultan heard of his
strength, he sent to him a sword that weighed twelve
pounds. It was worth one thousand guldens. And when
the sword was brought to him, he ordered that an ox, three
years old, should be brought to him, as he wished to try
the sword. When the ox came, he cut it into two parts at
one blow. This happened during Tämerlin’s lifetime.</p>

<hr />

<h2>25.—Of a king’s son.</h2>

<p>With Abubachar, was the son of a king of Great Tartary.
To him came messengers, wanting him to go home, that he
might be responsible for the kingdom. He asked Abubachir
to allow him to go; this he did, and so he went home with
six hundred horsemen; I was one of five [Christians?] who
went with him into Great Tartary. You must notice through
which countries he passed. First, through the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
called Strana, where silk grows; then through a country
called Gursey, where there are Christians, and they believe
in the Christian faith, and Saint Jörig is patron there.
After that, he passed through a country called Lochinschan;
there, also, silk grows; then through another called Schurban,
where silk grows of which the good stuffs are made at
Tamasch and at Kaffer, and also at Wursa, the capital of
the Infidels, situated in Turkey; this silk is also taken to
Venice and to Lickcha, where good velvet is worked; but
it is an unhealthy country. Afterwards he passed through
a country called Samabram;<a name="FNanchor_1_25" id="FNanchor_1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_25" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> then through one called
in the Tartar tongue, Temurtapit,<a name="FNanchor_a_25" id="FNanchor_a_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_25" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_2_25" id="FNanchor_2_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_25" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> which is as much as
to say, the Iron Gate. This divides Persia and Tartary.
Then he passed through a city called Origens; it is powerful,
and lies in the middle of a river called Edil.<a name="FNanchor_3_25" id="FNanchor_3_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_25" class="fnanchor">(3.)</a> Then
he travelled through a mountainous country called Setzulet,
where there are many Christians who have a bishop
there; their priests belong to the Order of the Shoeless,
who do not know Latin, and they sing and read their
prayers in the Tartar tongue. It is found that thus the
laity become stronger in the faith, and also many Infidels
are confirmed in the Christian faith, because they understand
the words that the priests sing and read. After that,
he went into Great Tartaria, and came to the lord named
Edigi, who had written and sent messengers to him, as he
wanted him to come and rule the kingdom. And when he
arrived, Edigi was waiting, having prepared to go into a
country called Ibissibur.<a name="FNanchor_b_25" id="FNanchor_b_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_25" class="fnanchor">2</a> It is to be noted, that it is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>custom for the king, in Great Tartary, to have a Chief to
rule over him, who can elect or depose a king, and has
also power over vassals. Now at that time Edigi was the
Chief. The vassals in Tartary wander about in winter and
summer, with their wives and children, and their cattle, and
when the king encamps, there must be erected one hundred
thousand huts. Now when the son of the above-named
king of Tartary, and who was named Zegre,<a name="FNanchor_4_25" id="FNanchor_4_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_25" class="fnanchor">(4.)</a> had come
to Edigi, he went with him into the above-named country,
Ibissibur, and they travelled two months before they arrived
there. There is a mountain in that country, which is
thirty-two days’ journey in extent. The people there, themselves
say, that at the extremity of the mountain is a
desert, and that the said desert is the end of the earth;
and in this same desert nobody can have an habitation,
because of snakes and wild beasts. On the same mountain
there are savages, who are not like other people, and they
live there. They are covered all over the body with hair,
except the hands and face, and run about like other wild
beasts in the mountain, and also eat leaves and grass, and
any thing they can find. The lord of the country sent to
Edigi, a man and a woman from among these savages, that
had been taken in the mountain.<a name="FNanchor_5_25" id="FNanchor_5_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_25" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> The horses are of
the same size as donkeys, and there are many wild beasts
that are not in Germany, and of which I do not know the
names. There are also in the above-named country, dogs,
that go in carts and in sledges; they are also made to carry
luggage, and are as large as donkeys. Dogs are eaten in
this country. It is also to be noted, that the people in this
country believe in Jesus Christ like the <span class="smcap">III</span> kings who came
and brought offerings to Christ at Bethlaem, and saw him
lying in the manger; and they have a picture, which is a
representation of our Lord in a manger, as the three holy
kings saw him, when they brought offerings to him. They
have this also in their temples, and say their prayers before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
it; and the people who are of this faith are called Ugine.<a name="FNanchor_6_25" id="FNanchor_6_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_25" class="fnanchor">(6)</a>
In Tartaria there are many people of this religion. It is
also the custom in the country, that when a young man, who
has not had a wife, dies, he is dressed in his best clothes,
and players carry him, and he is laid on a bier, and a
canopy is placed over him. And all the young people, also
dressed in their best clothes, go before, and the players with
them. The father and mother, and friends, also follow the
bier, and it is taken to the grave by the young people and
by the players, with singing and much merry-making. But
the father and mother and friends, go near the bier and
weep; and when they have buried him, they bring their
food and drink, and the young people and the players sit
down, and eat and drink by the grave with much rejoicing.
The father and mother and friends, sit on one side,
and lament, and when they have done, they take the father
and mother to the place where they live, and there they
lament; and so they end the ceremony which was as if they
had had a wedding, because he had no wife. In this country
they have nothing but millet, and they do not eat bread.
All this I have seen, and was there with the above-named
king’s son, Zeggra.</p>

<h2>26.—How one lord succeeds another lord.</h2>

<p>And after that Edigi and Zeggra had subdued the country
Ibissibur, they went into the country Walher, and conquered
it also, and afterwards they went back to their country.
At that time, there was a king in Great Tartaria who
was called Sedichbechan, and kan is as much as to say a
king, in the Tartar tongue. When he heard that Edigi had
come into his country, he took to flight. Edigi sent after
him, that he should be brought as a prisoner, but he was
killed in a battle.<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> Then Edigi elected a king named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Polet, who reigned one year and a half.<a name="FNanchor_2_26" id="FNanchor_2_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_26" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Then there was
one named Segelalladin, who expelled Polet; and after this,
Polet’s brother was king, and he reigned fourteen months.
Then came his brother, named Thebachk, who fought with
him for the kingdom, and killed him,<a name="FNanchor_3_26" id="FNanchor_3_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_26" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> and then there was
no king. But he had a brother called Kerumberdin, who
became king, and reigned five months. Then came his
brother Theback, and he expelled Kerimberdin and became
king. Then came Edigi and my lord Zeggra, and they
drove away the king, and Edigi made my lord the king as
he had promised. He was king for nine months. Then
came one named Machmet, and he fought with Zeggra and
with Edigi. Zeggra fled to a country called Distihipschach,
and Machmet became king. Then came one named Waroch;
he expelled Machmet and became king. After that, Machmet
recovered, and he drove away Waroch and was again
king. Then came one named Doblabardi, who drove away
Machmet and became king, and was king for three days
only. Then came the same Warach, who expelled Doblabardi,
and again became king. Then came my lord Machmet,
and he overcame Waroch and again became king. After
that, came my lord Zeggra, and he fought with Machmet
and was killed.<a name="FNanchor_4_26" id="FNanchor_4_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_26" class="fnanchor">(4)</a></p>

<hr />

<h2>27.—Of an Infidel woman, who had four thousand
maidens.</h2>

<p>During the time that I was with Zeggra, there came to
Edigi, and also to Zeggra, a Tartar woman named Sadurmelickh,<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
with four thousand maidens and women. She
was powerful, and her husband had been killed by a Tartar
king. She wanted to be revenged, and therefore came to
Edigi, so that he should assist her to expel the king. And
you must also know, that she and her women rode to battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
and fought with the bow, as well as men; and when the
women rode to battle, they had on one side a sword, and on
the other a bow. In a battle she had with a king, there
was the king’s cousin who had killed the husband of this
woman, and he was made a prisoner. He was brought before
the woman; she ordered him to kneel, and drew her
sword, and cut off his head at one blow, and said: “Now am
I revenged.” I was present there, and I also saw this.</p>

<hr />

<h2>28.—In what countries I have been.</h2>

<p>Now I have described the battles and the fights which
took place, during the time that I was with the Infidels.
Now I will also write and name the countries that I have
been in, since I left Bavaria. At first I went into Ungeren,
before the great expedition against the Infidels. There I
remained ten months, and after that we went amongst the
Infidels as is described. I have also been in Wallachy and
in its two chief cities; one is called Agrich,<a name="FNanchor_a_28" id="FNanchor_a_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_28" class="fnanchor">1</a>
the other Türckisch; also in a city called Übereil, situated on the
Tunow. There were the kocken<a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> and the galleys, in
which merchants bring their goods from the land of the Infidels.
It is also to be noted, that the people in Little and
in Great Walachy hold to the Christian faith, and they also
speak a particular language; they also allow their hair and
beard to grow, and never cut it. I have also been in Little
Walachy, and in Sybenbürgen which is a German country;
the capital of this country is called Hermenstat. Also in
Zwürtzenland; the capital is called Bassaw.<a name="FNanchor_b_28" id="FNanchor_b_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_28" class="fnanchor">2</a><a name="FNanchor_2_28" id="FNanchor_2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_28" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>are the countries on this side of the Tonow, in which I
have been.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_28" id="Footnote_a_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_28"><span class="label">1</span></a>Agrisch, now better known as Ardschisch in Walachia. For
Türckisch we should read Bukurescht. <i>F.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_b_28" id="Footnote_b_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_b_28"><span class="label">2</span></a>Brasowa or Burzelland in Siebenbürgen. Wurzerland was also
written Burzerland and Burzelland. It is to the south-east of Siebenbürgen,
its capital being Cronstadt, Brasowa in Slav, called Bassaw by
Schiltberger. <i>F.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<h2>29.—In which countries I have been, that lay between
the Tonow and the sea.</h2>

<p>Now will be noted the countries that are between the
Tunow and the sea, in which I have been. First, I have
been in three countries, which three countries are all called
Pulgrey. The first Pulgrey is where people cross from
Hungern to the Iron Gate; the capital is called Pudem.
The other Pulgrey above lies opposite to Walachy; the capital is
called Ternau. The third Pulgery lies where the Tunow
flows into the sea; the capital is called Kallacercka.<a name="FNanchor_a_29" id="FNanchor_a_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_29" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
I have also been in Greece; the capital is Adranapoli, which
city has fifty thousand houses. There is also a large city
by the White Sea in Greece, and it is called Salonikch;<a name="FNanchor_2_29" id="FNanchor_2_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_29" class="fnanchor">(2)</a>
and in this city lies Saint Sanctiniter, from whose grave oil
flows.<a name="FNanchor_b_29" id="FNanchor_b_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_29" class="fnanchor">2</a><a name="FNanchor_3_29" id="FNanchor_3_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_29" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> In the middle of the church there is a well, and
on his day the well is full of water, but it is dry on every
other day in the year. I have been in this city. There is
also a mighty city in Greece, called Seres; and all the territory
that lies between the Tünow and the sea, belongs to
the Turkish<a name="FNanchor_c_29" id="FNanchor_c_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_29" class="fnanchor">3</a> king. There is a city and a fortress called
Chalipoli; there the high sea is crossed. I myself crossed
there, over to Turkey. This same sea is crossed to go to
Constantinoppel. I was three months in the said city where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>people go over into Great Turkey. The capital of Turkey
is called Wursa. The city contains two hundred thousand
houses, and eight hospitals where poor people are received,
whether they be Christians, Infidels, or Jews. Three hundred
castles are dependant on this city, without excepting
the chief towns which are hereafter described. The first is
called Asia,<a name="FNanchor_d_29" id="FNanchor_d_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_d_29" class="fnanchor">4</a><a name="FNanchor_4_29" id="FNanchor_4_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_29" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> in which is the grave of St. John the Evangelist;
it is in a fertile country called Edein in the Infidel
tongue; but the natives call it Hohes. The other city and
country that belongs to it, is called Ismira, and Saint Nicholas
was bishop there.<a name="FNanchor_5_29" id="FNanchor_5_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_29" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> There is also a city and a country
called Maganasa,<a name="FNanchor_6_29" id="FNanchor_6_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_29" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> which is a fertile country. There
is also a city called Donguslu;<a name="FNanchor_7_29" id="FNanchor_7_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_29" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> the country that belongs
to it is called Serochon, and there the trees bear fruit twice
yearly. There is a city called Kachey, situated high up a
mountain, and has a fertile country called Kennan. There
is also a city called Anguri; it has a fertile country also
called Siguri.<a name="FNanchor_e_29" id="FNanchor_e_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_e_29" class="fnanchor">5</a> In this city are many Christians who hold
to the Ermenian faith; and they have a cross in their church
that shines day and night; even Infidels go to the church,
and they call the cross the bright stone. The Infidels also
wanted to carry it off and put it in their temple, but whoever
touches it, his hands become distorted. There is also
a city called Wegureisari,<a name="FNanchor_8_29" id="FNanchor_8_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_29" class="fnanchor">(8)</a> and the country is called by
the same name. There is also a country called Karaman,
the chief city being called Laranda. There is also in this
country a city called Könia, in which lies the saint, Schenisis,
who was first an Infidel priest, and was secretly baptised;
and when his end approached, received from an Armenian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>priest, the body of God in an apple. He has worked great
miracles. There is also a city called Gassaria, and the country
is of the same name. In this country Saint Basil was
bishop.<a name="FNanchor_9_29" id="FNanchor_9_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_29" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> I have also been in Sebast, which was once a
kingdom. There is a city on the Black Sea called Samson;
it is in a fertile country called Zegnikch. The above-named
countries and cities all belong to Turkey, and I have been in
them all. Item, there is a country called Zepun; it is on
the Black Sea. In this country they sow millet only, and
they make their bread of this millet. There is the kingdom
of Tarbesanda; it is a small and well protected country, and
fruitful in vineyards, and is on the Black Sea, not far from
a city called Kureson<a name="FNanchor_10_29" id="FNanchor_10_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_29" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> in the Greek tongue.</p>

<h2>30.—Of the castle of the sparrow-hawk, and how
it is guarded.</h2>

<p>There is on a mountain a castle, called that of the sparrow-hawk.
Within, is a beautiful virgin, and a sparrow-hawk on
a perch. Whoever goes there and does not sleep but watches
for three days and three nights, whatever he asks of the
virgin, that is chaste, that she will grant to him. And when
he finishes the watch, he goes into the castle and comes to a
fine palace, where he sees a sparrow-hawk standing on a
perch; and when the sparrow-hawk sees the man, he
screams, and the virgin comes out of her chamber, welcomes
him and says: “Thou hast served me and watched for three
days and three nights, and whatever thou now askest of me
that is pure, that will I grant unto thee.” And she does so.
But if anybody asks for something that exhibits pride, impudence,
or avarice, she curses him and his offspring, so
that he can no longer attain an honourable position.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<h2>31.—How a poor fellow watched the sparrow-hawk.</h2>

<p>There was also once a good poor fellow, who watched for
three days and three nights before the castle; and when he
had watched, he went into the palace, and when the sparrow-hawk
saw him, he screamed. The virgin came out of her
room and welcomed him, and said: “What dost thou require
of me. Whatever is of this world and that is honourable, I
will grant unto thee.” He asked her for nothing more than
that he and his family might live with honour; this was
granted. There also came the son of a king of Armenia,
who also watched for three days and three nights. After
that, he went into the palace where stood the sparrow-hawk.
The sparrow-hawk screamed, the virgin came out, welcomed
him and asked: “What dost thou want that is of this world
and that is honourable.” He asked for nothing, and said he
was the son of a mighty king of Armenia, and had silver and
gold enough, and also precious stones, but he had no wife,
and he asked her to be his wife. She answered him and
said: “Thy proud spirit that thou hast, must be broken in
thee and in all thy power”; and she cursed him and all his
kindred. There also went a lord of the Order of St. John,
who also watched and went into the palace. The virgin
came out, and asked him also what he desired. He asked
her for a purse that would never be empty, which was
granted. But after this, she cursed him and said: “The
avarice thou hast shewn, brings great evil to thee. Therefore
I curse thee, so that thy order may diminish and not
increase.” Then he left her.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></p>

<hr />

<h2>32.—More about the castle of the sparrow-hawk.</h2>

<p>During the time that I and my companions were there,
we asked a man to take us to the castle, and gave him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
money; and when we got to the place, one of my companions
wanted to remain and keep watch. He who brought
us advised him against it, and said that if he did not carry
out the watch, he would be lost, and nobody would know
where he went; the castle is also hidden by trees, so that
nobody knows the way to it. It is also forbidden by the
Greek priests, and they say that the devil has to do with it,
and not God. So we went on to a city called Kereson.
There is also a country that belongs to the above-named
kingdom, called Lasia,<a name="FNanchor_1_32" id="FNanchor_1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_32" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> and it is fertile in vineyards.
Greeks are in that country. I have also been in Lesser
Armenia; the capital is Ersinggan. There is also a city
called Kayburt,<a name="FNanchor_a_32" id="FNanchor_a_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_32" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_2_32" id="FNanchor_2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_32" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and it has a fertile country. Also a
city called Kamach,<a name="FNanchor_3_32" id="FNanchor_3_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_32" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> situated on a high mountain, and
below the mountain flows a river called the Eufrates; it is
one of the rivers that flows out of Paradise. This river also
flows through Lesser Armenia, and then courses through a
desert ten days’ journey across; then it is lost in a marsh,
so that nobody knows where it goes.<a name="FNanchor_4_32" id="FNanchor_4_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_32" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> It courses also
through Persia. There is also a country called Karasser;
it is fertile in vineyards.<a name="FNanchor_5_32" id="FNanchor_5_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_32" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> There is also a country called
Black Turkey; the capital is called Hamunt, and the people
are warlike.<a name="FNanchor_6_32" id="FNanchor_6_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_32" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> There is also a country called Churt, the
capital of which is Bestan.<a name="FNanchor_7_32" id="FNanchor_7_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_32" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> Item, a kingdom called Kursi,
where the people hold to the Christian faith, have a distinct
language and are a warlike people. There is a country
called Abkas, its capital Zuchtun;<a name="FNanchor_8_32" id="FNanchor_8_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_32" class="fnanchor">(8)</a> it is an unhealthy
country, and men and women wear flat caps on their heads,
which they do because the place is unhealthy. There is also
a small country called Megral, the capital is Kathon,<a name="FNanchor_b_32" id="FNanchor_b_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_32" class="fnanchor">2</a><a name="FNanchor_9_32" id="FNanchor_9_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_32" class="fnanchor">(9)</a>
and in which country they hold to the Greek faith. Also a
country called Merdin;<a name="FNanchor_10_32" id="FNanchor_10_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_32" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> this is a kingdom where there are

<h2>33.—In which countries silk is grown, and of Persia
and of other kingdoms.</h2>

<p>The chief city of all the kingdoms of Persia is called
Thaures.<a name="FNanchor_1_33" id="FNanchor_1_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_33" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> The king of Persia has a larger revenue from
the city of Thaures, than has the most powerful king in
Christendom, because a great many merchants come to it.
There is also a kingdom in Persia, the capital of which is
called Soltania. There is also a city called Rei,<a name="FNanchor_2_33" id="FNanchor_2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_33" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> in a large
country where they do not believe in Machmet as do other
Infidels. They believe in a certain Aly who is a great persecutor
of the Christian faith; and those of this doctrine are
called Raphak.<a name="FNanchor_a_33" id="FNanchor_a_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_33" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_33" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> There is also a city called Nachson;<a name="FNanchor_4_33" id="FNanchor_4_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_33" class="fnanchor">(4)</a>
it lays near the mountain where the ark stood in which was
Noah, and the country is fertile. In it are also three cities,
one called Maragara,<a name="FNanchor_5_33" id="FNanchor_5_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_33" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> the other Gelat,<a name="FNanchor_6_33" id="FNanchor_6_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_33" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> and the third
Kirna.<a name="FNanchor_7_33" id="FNanchor_7_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_33" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> All three are in a fertile country. There is also,
on a mountain, a city called Meya; it is a bishop’s see where
they hold to the Roman religion; the priests are of the
Order of Preachers, and sing in the Armenian tongue.<a name="FNanchor_8_33" id="FNanchor_8_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_33" class="fnanchor">(8)</a>
There is a rich country called Gilan, where rice and cotton
only is grown, and the people wear knitted shoes. There
is a large city called Ress,<a name="FNanchor_9_33" id="FNanchor_9_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_33" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> in a good country where good
silk kerchiefs are made. Also a city called Strawba,<a name="FNanchor_10_33" id="FNanchor_10_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_33" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> in a
good country. Another called Antioch;<a name="FNanchor_11_33" id="FNanchor_11_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_33" class="fnanchor">(11)</a> the city wall is
stained with the blood of Christians, so that it is red. And
a city called Aluitze.<a name="FNanchor_b_33" id="FNanchor_b_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_33" class="fnanchor">2</a><a name="FNanchor_12_33" id="FNanchor_12_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_33" class="fnanchor">(12)</a> Tämerlin besieged it for sixteen
years before he took it. There is also a country called
Massandaran, which is so wooded, that nobody can go into
it. There is a city called Scheckhy; it is in a fertile country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
near the White Sea.<a name="FNanchor_c_33" id="FNanchor_c_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_33" class="fnanchor">3</a><a name="FNanchor_13_33" id="FNanchor_13_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_33" class="fnanchor">(13)</a> In this country also is silk
grown. Item, a country called Schuruan, and the capital
is called Schomachy; it is a hot and unhealthy country, but
the best silk is grown there. There is also a city called
Hispahan, which is in a good country. There is also in
Persia the kingdom Horoson,<a name="FNanchor_d_33" id="FNanchor_d_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_d_33" class="fnanchor">4</a> and its capital is called
Hore,<a name="FNanchor_e_33" id="FNanchor_e_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_33" class="fnanchor">5</a><a name="FNanchor_14_33" id="FNanchor_14_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_33" class="fnanchor">(14)</a> which has three hundred thousand houses. In
this same country and kingdom, during the time that I was
amongst the Infidels, there was a man three hundred and
fifty years old. So the Infidels said. The nails on his hands
were one inch in length, his eyebrows hung down from his
eyes over his cheeks. He was without teeth, which had
fallen out twice, and for the third time two grew, but they
were weak and not as strong as they should be, and he could
not masticate nor eat with them; they had to feed him.
The hair in his ears went down to his jaw; the beard reached
to his knees. He had no hair on his head, and could not
speak, but he made himself understood with signs. They
were obliged to carry him as he could not walk. This man
was held to be a saint by the Infidels, and they went to him
on a pilgrimage as people do to a saint, and said that Almighty
God had chosen him, because for a thousand years
no man had lived so long as this man; and who honours
him, honours Almighty God, who had wrought such miracles
and signs in him. This man was called Phiradamschyech.<a name="FNanchor_15_33" id="FNanchor_15_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_33" class="fnanchor">(15)</a>
There is a city called Schiras; it is large and in a good country,
where no Christian is allowed to trade, especially in the
city. A city called Kerman<a name="FNanchor_16_33" id="FNanchor_16_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_33" class="fnanchor">(16)</a> in a good country, and a
city called Keschon which lies near the sea; there pearls
grow, and it is a good country. Item, a city called Hognus;
it is large and lies near the sea where one goes to Great
India, and great merchandise comes there from India. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>is a good country, wherein are found many precious stones
which are peculiar to it. There, also, is the city called
Kaff,<a name="FNanchor_17_33" id="FNanchor_17_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_33" class="fnanchor">(17)</a> also a good country, where all kinds of spices
are found, and whence also one goes to Great India. There
is a country called Walaschoen; it has a high mountain
where many precious stones are found; but nobody can take
them because of the serpents and wild beasts. When it
rains, it is the torrent that brings them down, then come
the experts who know them, and pick them out of the mud.
There are also unicorns in those mountains.<a name="FNanchor_18_33" id="FNanchor_18_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_33" class="fnanchor">(18)</a></p>

<h2>34.—Of the tower of Babilony that is of such great
height.</h2>

<p>I have also been in the kingdom of Babilonien. Babilonien
is called Waydat in the Infidel tongue. The great
Babilonie was surrounded by a wall, twenty-five leagues
broad, and one league is three Italian miles; the wall was
two hundred cubits high and fifty cubits thick, and the river
Euffrates courses through the middle of the city; but it is
now all in ruins, and there is no longer any habitation in it.
The tower of Babilonien is distant fifty four stadia, and four
stadia is an Italian mile, and in several places it is <span class="smcap">X</span> leagues
in length and in breadth. The tower is in the desert of
Arabia, on the road when one goes into the kingdom of
Kalda; but none can get there because of the dragons and
serpents, and other hurtful reptiles, of which there are many
in the said desert. The tower was built by a king who is
called in the Infidel tongue, Marburtirudt.<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> It is also to
be noted, that a league is three Lombard miles, and four
stadia is one Italian mile. One Italian mile should have one
thousand full paces, and one pace should have <span class="smcap lowercase">V</span> feet,<a name="FNanchor_a_34" id="FNanchor_a_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_34" class="fnanchor">1</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>one foot should have nine inches, and one inch is the first
member of the thumb.<a name="FNanchor_2_34" id="FNanchor_2_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_34" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Now I will also take note of
New Babilonien. New Babilonien is separated from Great
Babilony by a river called Schatt;<a name="FNanchor_3_34" id="FNanchor_3_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_34" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> it is a large river, and
in it are many sea monsters that come from the Indian sea.
Near the river grows a fruit tree called the date, but the
Infidels call it kinna,<a name="FNanchor_4_34" id="FNanchor_4_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_34" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> and nobody can pick the fruit until
the storks come and drive away the serpents, which live
under the tree and on it; for this reason nobody can get the
fruit which grows twice during the year. It is also to be
noted, that in the city of Babilony two languages are spoken,
the Arabic and Persian. There is also a garden in Babilony,
in which are all kinds of beasts; this garden is ten miles
long and enclosed by a wall, so that none can get out. In
this garden, the lions have a place to themselves in which
they can move about. I have also seen the garden. In this
kingdom the people are not warlike.<a name="FNanchor_5_34" id="FNanchor_5_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_34" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> Item, I have also
been in Lesser India, which is a fine kingdom. The capital
is called Dily. In this country are many elephants, and
animals called surnasa, which is like a stag, but it is a tall
animal, and has a long neck four fathoms in length or longer.
It has long fore legs, and the hinder are short.<a name="FNanchor_6_34" id="FNanchor_6_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_34" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> There are
many animals in Lesser India. There are also many parrots,
ostriches, and lions. There are also many other animals and
birds, of which I cannot give the names. There is also a
country called Zekatay;<a name="FNanchor_7_34" id="FNanchor_7_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_34" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> the capital is called Samerchant,
and it is a large and mighty city. In this country the language
is distinct; it is half Turkish and half Persian, and
the people are warlike. In this country they do not eat
bread. It is also to be noted, that an Infidel lord named
Tämerlin had conquered all the country during the time that
I was with him. I have been in all those countries; but
he conquered many other countries in which I have not
been.</p>

<h2>35.—Of Great Tartaria.<a name="FNanchor_1_35" id="FNanchor_1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_35" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></h2>

<p>I have also been in Great Tartaria, and of the custom of
the country it is to be noted, first, that nothing besides
millet is sown. They do not eat bread, and they do not drink
wine, but they drink the milk of mares and of camels, and
they also eat camel and horse flesh. It is also to be noted,
that the king of these countries and his vassals pass winter
and summer in the fields, with their wives and children, with
cattle and all that belongs to them; and they go from one
pasturage to the other, because it is a flat country. It is
also to be noted, that when they choose a king, they take
him and seat him on white felt, and raise him in it three
times.<a name="FNanchor_2_35" id="FNanchor_2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_35" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Then they lift him up and carry him round the
tent, and seat him on a throne, and put a golden sword in
his hand. Then he must be sworn as is the custom. It is
also to be noted, that when they eat or drink, they sit on the
ground, as all Infidels do. There is not a more warlike
people among the Infidels than the Great<a name="FNanchor_a_35" id="FNanchor_a_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_35" class="fnanchor">1</a> Tartars, who can
fight and perform journeys as they do. I myself have seen
them bleed [their horses] and drink the blood after they
have cooked it. This they do when they are in want of food.
I have also seen when they are long on a journey, that they
take a piece of flesh, cut it into slices, place it under the
saddle, and ride on it, and eat it when they were hungry;
but they salt it first and think that it will not spoil, because
it becomes dry from the warmth of the horse, and becomes
tender under the saddle from riding, after the juice has
gone out of it. This they do when they have no time to
prepare their food. It is also the custom, that when the
king rises in the morning, they bring to him some mare’s
milk in a golden goblet, which he drinks fasting.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_35" id="Footnote_a_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_35"><span class="label">1</span></a>The word is “roten” in the text, doubtlessly for “grossen”.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<h2>36.—The countries in which I have been, that belong
to Tartary.</h2>

<p>Here is to be noted in which countries I have been, that
belong to Great Tartary. A country called Horosaman;<a name="FNanchor_a_36" id="FNanchor_a_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_36" class="fnanchor">1</a>
the name of the capital is Orden, and it lies in a river called
Edil, which is a great river.<a name="FNanchor_1_36" id="FNanchor_1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_36" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> There is also a country
called Bestan; its capital is Zulat, and it is a mountainous
country. Item, a city called Haitzicherchen, which is a large
city,<a name="FNanchor_2_36" id="FNanchor_2_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_36" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and in a good country. Another city called Sarei;
there, is the residence of the kings of the Tartars. There is
also a city called Bolar, in which are different kinds of
beasts.<a name="FNanchor_3_36" id="FNanchor_3_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_36" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> Also a city called Ibissibur,<a name="FNanchor_4_36" id="FNanchor_4_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_36" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> and a city Asach,
which the Christians call Alathena.<a name="FNanchor_5_36" id="FNanchor_5_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_36" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> It has a river, called
Tena, and much cattle. They send large kocken and galleys
full of fish from this country, and they go to Venice, Genoa,
and the islands that are in the sea. Item, there is a
country called Ephepstzach; its capital is Vulchat.<a name="FNanchor_b_36" id="FNanchor_b_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_36" class="fnanchor">2</a><a name="FNanchor_6_36" id="FNanchor_6_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_36" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> In
this country every kind of corn is cultivated. A city called
Kaffa, which lies by the Black Sea, and is surrounded by two
walls. Within one wall are six thousand houses, in which are
Italians, Greeks, and Armenians; it is a chief city on the Black
Sea, and has within the outer walls, <span class="smcap">XI</span> thousand houses, in
which are many Christians; Romans, Greeks, Armenians, and
Syrians. There are also three bishops; a Roman, a Greek, and
an Armenian. There are also many Infidels who have their
particular temple. The city has four towns subject to it;
they are by the sea. There are also two kinds of Jews in
the city, and they have two synagogues, and four thousand
houses are in the suburbs.<a name="FNanchor_7_36" id="FNanchor_7_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_36" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> Item, a city called Karckeri,<a name="FNanchor_8_36" id="FNanchor_8_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_36" class="fnanchor">(8)</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>in a good country called Sudi; but the Infidels call it
That;<a name="FNanchor_9_36" id="FNanchor_9_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_36" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> there are Christians of the Greek faith in it, and
there are good vineyards. It lies near the Black Sea, and
in this country Saint Clement was thrown into the sea.
Close by, is a city, called in the Infidel tongue, Serucherman.<a name="FNanchor_10_36" id="FNanchor_10_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_36" class="fnanchor">(10)</a>
Item, a country called Starchas, which also lies
by the Black Sea, where the people are of the Greek faith;
but they are a wicked people, because they sell their own
children to the Infidels, and steal the children of other
people and sell them; they are also highway robbers, and
have a peculiar language. It is also their custom, that when
one is killed by lightning, they lay him in a box and put it
on a high tree. Then all the people in the neighbourhood
come, and bring their food and drink under the tree; they
dance and enjoy themselves under it; they kill oxen and
lambs, and give them away for the sake of God. This they
do for three successive days, and at the end of a year they
come to where the dead man lies, near the tree, and again do
what they did before, until the body putrefies. This they
do, because they suppose that a man struck by lightning is
a saint.<a name="FNanchor_11_36" id="FNanchor_11_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_36" class="fnanchor">(11)</a> Item, the kingdom of Rewschen, which is tributary
to the Tartar king. It is to be noted, that there are three
tribes amongst the Great<a name="FNanchor_c_36" id="FNanchor_c_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_36" class="fnanchor">3</a> Tartars. One is called Kayat,<a name="FNanchor_d_36" id="FNanchor_d_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_d_36" class="fnanchor">4</a> the
other Inbu,<a name="FNanchor_e_36" id="FNanchor_e_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_e_36" class="fnanchor">5</a> the third Mugal.<a name="FNanchor_12_36" id="FNanchor_12_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_36" class="fnanchor">(12)</a> It is also to be noted, that
Tartary is a three months journey in extent, in which no wood
or stones are to be found, only grass and shrubs. The countries
described all belong to Great Tartary, in all of which I
have been. I have also been in Arabia; there the capital is
called in the Infidel tongue, Missir.<a name="FNanchor_f_36" id="FNanchor_f_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_f_36" class="fnanchor">6</a> The city in this kingdom
has twelve thousand streets, and each street has twelve

sultan, who is king over all Infidel kings, and lord of all
Infidels. He is a mighty lord in silver and gold, and in precious
stones, and has daily twenty thousand men at his
court.<a name="FNanchor_13_36" id="FNanchor_13_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_36" class="fnanchor">(13)</a> It is also to be noted, that no person can be made

<h2>37.—How many kings-sultan there were, whilst I
was amongst the Infidels.</h2>

<p>You should know, and take note, how many kings-sultan
there were during the time that I was there. The first king-sultan
was named Marochloch; then there was one named
Mathas, king; he was made a prisoner, and placed between
two planks and sawn in two parts, lengthways. After him,
was a king named Jusuphda, with whom I was for eight
months; he was made a prisoner and beheaded. After him
was one named Zechem; then one called Schyachin, who
was fixed on an iron spike; for it is the custom in this kingdom,
that when two fight for that kingdom, whichever
overcomes the other and brings him to prison, takes him
when convenient and dresses him like a king, and leads him
to a house made for the purpose, in which there are iron
spikes, and he is put on one of those spikes, so that it comes
through at the neck, and on the spike he must rot.<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
There was a certain king named Malleckchafcharff; this king
invited to a marriage, [those] in Rom, in all Christendom,
and also in all lands. Now you must note what is his title
and superscription.<a name="FNanchor_2_37" id="FNanchor_2_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_37" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> We, Balmander,<a name="FNanchor_a_37" id="FNanchor_a_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_37" class="fnanchor">1</a> the all-powerful
of Carthago,<a name="FNanchor_3_37" id="FNanchor_3_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_37" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> Sultan of the noble Saracens, Lord of Zuspillen,

Nazareth.<a name="FNanchor_6_37" id="FNanchor_6_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_37" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> The Lord of Synay, of Talapharum, and
of the valley of Josaphat. The Lord of Germoni, around

miles in length, and inhabited by seventy-two languages.<a name="FNanchor_8_37" id="FNanchor_8_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_37" class="fnanchor">(8)</a>
The Lord of Paradise and of the rivers that flow from there,
situated in our country of Capadocie; the guardian of the
caves,<a name="FNanchor_9_37" id="FNanchor_9_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_37" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> the mighty emperor of Constantinoppel, Amorach
of Kaylamer, the mighty emperor of Galgarien, the Lord of
the withered tree, the Lord where the sun and the moon
rise and set, from first to last; the lord [of the places] where
Enoch and Helyas are buried. Item, the protector of the
first Prester John, in enclosed Rumany, and guardian of
Wadach. Guardian of Alexander, Founder of the fortified
city of Babilonie, where the seventy-two languages were invented.
Emperor king of all kings. The Lord of Christians,
Jews, and Infidels. Destructor of the Gods.<a name="FNanchor_10_37" id="FNanchor_10_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_37" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> Thus
did he write to Rom when he wanted to have his daughter’s
marriage, at which marriage I also was present. It is
also to be noted, that it is the custom in the country of the
king-sultan, that during the week of their feast, married
women are at liberty to be wanton with men if it be their
desire, without their husbands or anybody else having anything
to say, because it is the custom. It is also the custom
for the king-sultan, when he rides into a city, or when
people from strange countries come to him, to cover his face
that none may see it; and if it be a great guest, he must
first kneel three times<a name="FNanchor_d_37" id="FNanchor_d_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_d_37" class="fnanchor">4</a> and kiss the ground, then stand
up and go near him. If he is an Infidel, he kisses his bare
hand, but if he is a Christian, he draws his hand into his
sleeve, and puts out the sleeve which he must kiss. When
the king-sultan sends a messenger, he has at the several
stations on the road, horses ready with all that is needed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>His messenger, whom he sends, has a bell at his girdle; he
covers it with a cloth until he gets near a station, then he
removes it and lets it ring. When it is heard at the station,
a horse is prepared for him, and he finds it ready. He rides
to another station, and there he again finds one ready. This
he goes on doing, until he gets to the place to which he was
sent. This is done on all the roads of the king-sultan.<a name="FNanchor_11_37" id="FNanchor_11_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_37" class="fnanchor">(11)</a> It
is also to be noted, that the king-sultan also sends letters by
pigeons, because he has many enemies, and is afraid that
they might stop his messengers. They are sent mostly
from Archey to Tamasgen, between which places is a great
desert. It is also to be noted, how the pigeons are sent
to any city to which the king-sultan wishes to have them
sent. Two pigeons must be put together, and sugar must
be put into their food, and they are not allowed to fly; and
when they know each other well, the hen-pigeon is taken to
the king, and he keeps it, and marks the cock-pigeon that
it may be known from which city it is; it is then put into
a separate place that is prepared, and the hen-pigeon is no
longer allowed inside. They no longer give him so much to
eat, and no more sugar as he used to have; this is done
that he may wish to return as soon as possible to the place
where he was before, and where he was trained. When they
wish to despatch him, the letter is tied under a wing, and he
flies away straight for the house where he was trained. There
he is caught and the letter taken from him, and they send it to
whomsoever it belongs.<a name="FNanchor_12_37" id="FNanchor_12_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_37" class="fnanchor">(12)</a> When a guest comes to the king-sultan,
whether he be a lord or a merchant, they give him a
pass; and when the letter is shewn in his country, they
kneel when it is read, and they kiss it, and shew the guest
great honour and attention, and they take him over the
country from one place to the other. It is also to be noted,
that when the ambassador of a king, or of some other lord of
a foreign country, comes, it is the custom among the Infidels
to attach to him a chief with three or four hundred, or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
six hundred horsemen; and when the king-sultan becomes
aware of him, he is seated on his throne in attire ornamented
with precious stones, and having seven curtains before him.
And when the lord who is sent on the embassage wants to
enter, one curtain is withdrawn after the other, and each time
he must bow and kiss the ground. When the last is withdrawn,
he kneels before the king, who holds out to him his
hand; he kisses it and then delivers his message. There is a
bird in Arabia called sacka,<a name="FNanchor_13_37" id="FNanchor_13_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_37" class="fnanchor">(13)</a> which is larger than a crane,
and has a long neck, and a broad and long beak. It is black and
has large feet, which are much like the feet of a goose in the
lower parts; its feet are also very black; its colour is the
same as that of a crane; it has a large crop in front of its
neck, in which it has quite a quart of water. It is the habit of
this bird, to fly to a river and fill its crop with water; then it
flies away to the desert where there is no water, and pours
it out of its crop into a hole in the rock. Then come the
little birds of the desert to drink, when he attacks those
birds for his food. This is the same desert that people cross,
who go to the tomb of Machmet where he is buried.</p>

<h2>38.—Of the mountain of St. Catherine.</h2>

<p>The Red Sea is two hundred and forty Italian miles broad;
it is called the Red Sea, but it is not red, but the land
around is in some parts red. It is the same as other seas,
and is near Arabia, and is crossed to go to Saint Catherine,
and by whoever wishes [to go] to Mount Sinay, where I have
not been; but I have heard about it from Christians and Infidels,
because Infidels also go there. The Infidels call the
mountain Muntagi,<a name="FNanchor_a_38" id="FNanchor_a_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_38" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_38" id="FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> which is the same as calling it the
mountain of the apparition, because God appeared before
Moysi on this mountain, in a flame of fire, when he spoke to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>him. On the mountain there is a monastery, in which are
Greeks who form a large brotherhood; they do not drink wine,
and live like recluses; they do not eat meat, and are a religious
people, and fast always. Within, are many burning
lamps, and of the oil for burning and eating, they have enough
sent to them by a miracle from God, which happens in this way.
When the olives are ripe, all the birds that are in the country
come together, and each bird brings a branch in its beak to
the mount of Saint Catherine, and they bring so many, that
they have enough for the lamps and for food. In the church,
behind the altar, is the place where God appeared to Moysi
in the burning bush; when the monks go near it they are
bare-footed, because it is a holy place; because our Lord
commanded Moysi to take off his shoes because the place is
holy, and the place is called the place of God. Three steps
higher up, is the high altar where lay the bones of Saint
Catherine; the abbot shews this sanctuary to pilgrims, and
he has a silver thing with which he touches the sanctuary and
the bones. In this way he obtains an exudation of oil, which
is neither like oil nor balsam; this he gives to the pilgrims,
and shews there the head of Saint Catherine and many
other sacred things. A great miracle takes place in this monastery,
where there are as many lamps that are always burning,
as there are monks. When a monk is about to die, his
lamp becomes dim, and when it goes out, he dies. When the
abbot dies, he who sings the mass finds on the altar a letter, in
which is written the name of the man who is to be the
abbot, and his lamp re-lights itself. In the same abbey is
the spring where Moysi caused the water to flow, when he
struck the rock with his staff. Not far from the said abbey,
is the church built in honour of our Lady, where she appeared
to the monks; higher up, is the chapel of Moysi, to
which he fled when he saw our Lord face to face. There is
also on the mount, the chapel of the prophet Helyas; the
mount is called Oreb; close to the chapel of Moysi is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
the site where our Lord delivered to him the tables with
the ten commandments, and on this same mountain is the
cave in which Moysi remained, when he fasted forty days.
From this valley one gets to a larger valley, and gets to
the mountain to which Saint Catherine was carried by angels.
In the same valley is a church, built in honour of the forty
martyrs, in which the monks often sing the mass. The
valley is cold, and the place on Saint Catherine’s mount
where she was carried by the angels, is nothing but a heap
of stones; but there has been a chapel which is destroyed.
There are also two mounts called Sinay, which are near
each other, except for the valley which is between them.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_38" id="Footnote_a_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_38"><span class="label">1</span></a>Muntagi should be called Huschan-Daghi, Mountain of the Apparition.

<h2>39.—Of the withered tree.</h2>

<p>Not far from Ebron is the village of Mambertal,<a name="FNanchor_1_39" id="FNanchor_1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_39" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> where
is the withered tree which the Infidels call kurruthereck;
it is also called carpe,<a name="FNanchor_a_39" id="FNanchor_a_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_39" class="fnanchor">1</a> and has been since the time of Abraham,
and was always green until our Lord died on the cross;
since His death it has withered. It is found in prophecy,
that a prince will come from the Occident towards the sun,
and will with the Christians take possession of the holy
sepulchre, and will cause the celebration of the mass under
the withered tree; then will the tree become green and
bear fruit. The Infidels hold it in great honour, and take
good care of it. It has also the virtue, that when anybody
suffers from epilepsy, and he passes by it, he falls no more;
and it possesses many other virtues, so that it is well taken
care of.<a name="FNanchor_2_39" id="FNanchor_2_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_39" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Item, it is two full days journey from Jherusalem
to Nazereth where our Lord was brought up, which
was formerly a considerable city; but now it is a small village,
the houses are far from each other, and mountains are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>around it. There was a church where our Lady received
the salutation of the archangel Gabryel, but now there is
only a pillar.<a name="FNanchor_3_39" id="FNanchor_3_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_39" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> The Infidels guard it well, because of the
offerings which the Christians bring there; these they take
away because they are enemies, but they dare not do anything
to them, because it is forbidden by the sultan.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_39" id="Footnote_a_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_39"><span class="label">1</span></a>Selvy is the Turkish for cypress tree. This word appears as Sirpe

<h2>40.—Of Jherusalem and of the Holy Sepulchre.</h2>

<p>When I was at Jherusalem, I was there during a great
war, and our thirty thousand [men] were encamped near
the Jordan on a beautiful meadow; this is the reason why
I could not see all the holy places well; but I will relate
some things. I went twice to Jherusalem with a koldigen<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
named Joseph. Jherusalem lies between two mounts, and
there is great want of water. The Infidels call Jherusalem,
Kurtzitalil.<a name="FNanchor_2_40" id="FNanchor_2_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_40" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> The church in which is the holy sepulchre
is a fine church, high and circular; it is covered all over
with lead, and is outside the city. In the middle of the
church, in the chapel on the right hand, is the holy sepulchre,
wherein nobody can enter, unless he is a great lord; but a
stone of the holy sepulchre is let into the wall of the tabernacle,
and the pilgrims can kiss and touch it.<a name="FNanchor_3_40" id="FNanchor_3_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_40" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> There is
a lamp that burns all the year until Good Friday, then it
goes out, and re-lights itself on Easter day. There is also
on Easter eve a brightness above the holy sepulchre, that is
like fire;<a name="FNanchor_4_40" id="FNanchor_4_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_40" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> many people come there from Ermenia, from
Siria, and from the country of Prester John, to see this
brightness in the church; On the right hand is Mount
Calvarie where is <em>an altar</em> (?);<a name="FNanchor_a_40" id="FNanchor_a_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_40" class="fnanchor">1</a> there, is the pillar to which
our Lord was bound whilst he was scourged. Near the said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>altar, are forty-two steps under ground; there, were found
the holy cross and those of the two thieves. In front of the
gate of the church, are eighteen steps; there, our Lord on
the cross said to his mother: “Woman, behold, that is thy
child”; and he said to Saint Johannsen: “Behold, that is
thy mother.” He went up those very steps when he carried
the cross; and on the same side, but a little higher, is the
chapel in which are the priests from the country of Prester
John.<a name="FNanchor_5_40" id="FNanchor_5_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_40" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> In front of the city is the church of Saint Steffan,
where he was stoned;<a name="FNanchor_6_40" id="FNanchor_6_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_40" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> and against the valley of Josophat,
is the golden gate before the church where is the holy sepulchre.
Not far from there is the great hospital of Saint Johanns,
in which they receive sick people. The hospital has one
hundred and thirty-four columns; there is another hospital
that rests on fifty-four marble columns.<a name="FNanchor_7_40" id="FNanchor_7_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_40" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> Below the hospital
is a fine church, called that of our great Lady, and
between them is another church called that of our Lady,
where Mary Magdalen and Mary Cleophas tore out their
hair when they saw God on the cross. In front of the
church where is the holy sepulchre, is the temple of our
Lord; it is very fine, high, and circular; it is also wide and
covered with tin; there is also a fine open space with houses
around, and it is paved with white marble; the Infidels do
not allow either Christians or Jews to enter it.<a name="FNanchor_8_40" id="FNanchor_8_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_40" class="fnanchor">(8)</a> Near to
the great temple is a church covered with lead, and called
the throne of Salomon;<a name="FNanchor_9_40" id="FNanchor_9_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_40" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> and on the left hand is a palace,
called the temple of Salomon. A church there, is in honour
of Saint Annen, in which is a well; whoever bathes in it is
healed, whatever be his disease. It was there our Lord
healed the bed-ridden man.<a name="FNanchor_10_40" id="FNanchor_10_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_40" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> Not far from this is the
house of Pilate, and close by, is the house of Herod<a name="FNanchor_11_40" id="FNanchor_11_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_40" class="fnanchor">(11)</a> who
ordered the children to be killed. A little further, there is
a church called that of Saint Annen, in which is an arm of
Saint Johannes Crisostimus, and the greater portion of the
head of Saint Stephen.<a name="FNanchor_12_40" id="FNanchor_12_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_40" class="fnanchor">(12)</a> There is a street which leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Mount Syon, where is the church of Saint James. Not far
from the mount, is the church of our Lady, where she lived
and also where she died. When one is on Mount Syon,
there is a chapel in which is the stone that was over the
holy sepulchre; there is also a pillar to which our Lord was
bound, when the Jews scourged him. In the same place was
the house of Annas, who was the Jewish bishop. At the top
of thirty-two steps, is the place where our Lord washed the
feet of his disciples; near the same place, Saint Stephen was
buried. This is also the place where our Lady heard the
angels sing the mass; in the same chapel, near the high
altar sat the twelve holy apostles on the day of Pentecost,
when the Holy Ghost came upon them. At this same place,
our Lord celebrated the Passover with his disciples. Mount
Syon is in the city of Jherusalem, and stands higher than
the city.<a name="FNanchor_13_40" id="FNanchor_13_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_40" class="fnanchor">(13)</a> Below the mount is a beautiful castle which
was built by the king-sultan.<a name="FNanchor_14_40" id="FNanchor_14_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_40" class="fnanchor">(14)</a> On the mount are buried
King Soldan<a name="FNanchor_15_40" id="FNanchor_15_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_40" class="fnanchor">(15)</a> and King David, and many other kings.
Between Mount Syon and Salomon’s temple, is the house
where our Lord raised the maiden from death; it is also the
place where Isayas the prophet was buried. In front of the
city of Jherusalem, lies buried the prophet Dayel. Between
the mount of Oliueli and Jherusalem, is the valley of Josophat
which reaches to the city. There is a brook in the valley of
Josophat where is the sepulchre of our Lady, <span class="smcap">XL</span> steps below
ground.<a name="FNanchor_16_40" id="FNanchor_16_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_40" class="fnanchor">(16)</a> Not far off is a church where Jacob and
Zacharias the prophets are buried.<a name="FNanchor_b_40" id="FNanchor_b_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_40" class="fnanchor">2</a> Above the valley is the
mount of Olives, and close to the mount, is the mount of Galilee.<a name="FNanchor_17_40" id="FNanchor_17_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_40" class="fnanchor">(17)</a>
From Jherusalem <em>two hundred stadia are counted</em>
to the Dead Sea, <em>which is one hundred and fifty stadia
wide</em>,<a name="FNanchor_18_40" id="FNanchor_18_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_40" class="fnanchor">(18)</a> <em>and into which flows the river Jordan, at the source
of which</em>,<a name="FNanchor_c_40" id="FNanchor_c_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_c_40" class="fnanchor">3</a> and at no distance, is the church of Saint Johannes;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>and a little higher up, Christians usually bathe in the Jordan,<a name="FNanchor_19_40" id="FNanchor_19_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_40" class="fnanchor">(19)</a>
which is neither broad nor deep, but there are good
fish in it; its source is from two springs on the same mountain,
one spring is called the Jor, the other, Don, and from
these it has its name;<a name="FNanchor_20_40" id="FNanchor_20_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_40" class="fnanchor">(20)</a> it flows through a lake, then
under a mountain, and comes up on a beautiful plain, where
the Infidels often have a fair during the year.<a name="FNanchor_21_40" id="FNanchor_21_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_40" class="fnanchor">(21)</a> In this
same plain is the grave of Saint James, and on this same
plain we encamped with our young king, with thirty thousand
men sent to him by the Turkish king. There are
many Christians on the Jordan, and they have many churches
there. It is to be noted, that the Infidels took possession
of the holy sepulchre, twelve hundred and eighty years from
Christ.<a name="FNanchor_22_40" id="FNanchor_22_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_40" class="fnanchor">(22)</a> Ebron lies seven leagues from Jherusalem, and
is the chief city of the Philistines; on Ebron are the graves
of the patriarchs, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
of their wives Eva, Sara, Rebecca, and Lia. There is a fine
church which the Infidels take great care of, and hold in
great honour, because the holy fathers lie there; they do not
allow either Christians or Jews to enter, unless they have
the permission of the king-sultan, and they say, we are
not worthy to enter so holy a place. In front of the city
of Miser, which the Christians call Cair, there is a garden
where balsam grows; it grows there only, and in India.
The king-sultan enjoys a large income from this balsam.
The Infidels often adulterate it, and merchants and druggists
also mix it, and this they do that they may make more
profit.<a name="FNanchor_23_40" id="FNanchor_23_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_40" class="fnanchor">(23)</a> Genuine balsam is pure and clear, and has a
pleasant taste, and is yellow; but when it is thick and red,
it is not genuine. Take a drop of balsam in the hand, and
expose it to the sun; if it is good, you cannot keep it long
in the sun, because you feel the great heat. Take a drop of
balsam on a knife, and put it near a glowing fire; if the
balsam burns, it is genuine. Take a silver cup or goblet full
of goat’s milk, stir it quickly and put a drop of balsam into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
it; if it is good, the milk will immediately curdle, and so the
balsam is proved.</p>

<h2>41.—Of the spring in Paradise, with <span class="smcap">IIII</span> rivers.</h2>

<p>In the middle of Paradise there is a spring, from which
flow four rivers that course through different countries.
The first is called Rison and flows through India; in this
river are found many precious stones and gold. The other
is called Nilus: it flows through the country of the Moors
and through Egypt. The third is called Tigris, and flows
through Asia and Great Armenia. The fourth is called the
Eufrates, which flows through Persia and Lesser Armenia.
Of these four rivers I have seen three.<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_41" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> One is called
Nilus, the other Tigris, the third, Eufrates. I have been
many years in the countries through which these rivers flow,
and have there experienced many things that are good and
bad, of which a great deal more might be said.</p>

<h2>42.—How pepper grows in India.</h2>

<p>I have not been in Great India where the pepper grows,
but I have heard in the Infidel country from those who have
seen it, where and how it grows. In the first place, I have
understood and heard, that it grows near the city of Lambe,
in a forest called Lambor;<a name="FNanchor_1_42" id="FNanchor_1_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_42" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> this forest is quite <span class="smcap">XIIII</span> days
journey in length. In this forest are II cities and many villages
in which are Christians; it is very hot where the
pepper grows. The pepper grows on trees which are like
the wild vine, and is something like the sloe when it is
green; and they bind them to poles as they do the vine, and
the trees bear a great deal. When it is green it is ripe,
then they cut it as they do grapes, and expose it to the sun
until it is dry. Three kinds of pepper grow; the long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
black grows with the leaves. There is the white, which is
the best, and they keep it in the country; but not so much
of this grows as of the other. There are also many serpents
there, produced by the heat. Some people say, that when
the pepper is to be gathered, fires are made in the forest to
drive away the serpents, therefore the pepper becomes
black; but this is not the case, because if they made a fire,
the trees would wither and bear no more fruit; but the
truth is, that they wash their hands with the juice of an
apple which they call liuon,<a name="FNanchor_2_42" id="FNanchor_2_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_42" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> or of some other plant; the
serpents escape from the smell, and then they gather the
pepper without trouble. In the same country they also
grow good ginger, and many spices and aromatics.</p>

<h2>43.—Of Allexandria.</h2>

<p>Alexandria is quite seven Italian miles long, and three
broad, and is a fine and pretty city, and the river Nilus
flows past the city into the sea; and the city has no other
drinking water, and it is conducted into the city by means
of cisterns. Many merchants come there from over the sea,
from Italian countries, from Venice and from Genoa. Those
from Genoa have their own counting-houses at Alexandria,
and those from Venice likewise.<a name="FNanchor_1_43" id="FNanchor_1_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_43" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> It is the custom at
Alexandria, that at the hour of vespers, all the Italians must
be in their counting-houses, and no longer without, about
the city, which is strictly forbidden. Then an Infidel comes
and locks up the counting-house, and takes away the key
until the morning, when he comes and opens it again.
Thus they take care that the Italians shall not take their
city, because they were once conquered by the king of
Zipern.<a name="FNanchor_2_43" id="FNanchor_2_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_43" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> Near the port of Alexandria there is a fine high
tower, on which there was not long ago a mirror, in which
one could see from Alexandria toward Cipern those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
were on the sea; and whatever they were doing, all could
be seen in this mirror at Allexandria, so that at the time
that the king of Zipern went to war with Allexandria, he
could do them no harm. Then came a priest to the king of
Ziperen, and asked what he would give him if he broke the
mirror. The king replied, that if he would break the mirror,
he would give him whichever bishopric he might choose to
have in his country. The priest then went to Rome to the
Pope, and said: That he would break the mirror at Allexandria,
if he would allow him to abjure the Christian faith.
He gave him permission that he might do so in words, and
not in deeds nor with the heart. Now he did this for the
sake of the Christian faith, because the Christians at sea
suffered many injuries from the Infidels, through this mirror.
The priest returned from Rome to Alexandria, and was converted
to the faith of the Infidels, and learnt their writing,
and became an Infidel priest and their preacher, and
taught them the Infidel faith against the Christian faith,
and they held him in great honour, and wondered, because
he had been a Christian priest, and they trusted in him very
much. They asked him which temple in the city he wished
for, as they would give it to him for his life time. There
was also a temple in the middle of the tower where the
mirror was; this temple he asked for, for his life time; they
gave it to him together with the keys of the mirror. There
he remained nine years, and then one day he sent to the
king of Zypperen that he should come with his galleys, and
he would break the mirror which was in his power, and he
thought, that, after breaking the mirror, if the galleys were
there, he would go on board. One morning many galleys
came, he struck the mirror three blows with a hammer before
it broke, and from the noise all the people in the city
were frightened, and ran to the tower and fell on him, so
that he could not get away; then he jumped out of a window
of the tower, into the sea, and was killed. Soon afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the king of Zyperen came with a large force, and took
Allexandria, and remained in it three days.<a name="FNanchor_3_43" id="FNanchor_3_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_43" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> Then came
the king-sultan, and he marched upon him so that he could
not remain; and he burnt the city, and took away with him
many people with their wives and children, and much
booty.</p>

<h2>44.—Of a great giant.</h2>

<p>It is to be noted, that in Egypt there was a giant, who was
called in the Infidel tongue, Allenklaisser. In this country
is the city called Missir, but the Christians call it Kayr, and
it is the capital of the king-sultan. In this same city are
twelve thousand baking ovens. Now the said giant was so
strong, that one day he brought into the city a bundle of
wood to heat all the ovens, and one bundle was enough;
each baker gave him a loaf, which makes twelve thousand
loaves. All these he ate in one day. The shin-bone of this
giant is in Arabia, in a valley between two mountains. There
is a deep valley between the rocks, where flows a river at
such a depth that no person can see it, one only hears its
rush. It is in this same valley that the shin-bone of the
giant serves as a bridge; and whoever comes there, whether
they are riding or on foot, must pass over this shin-bone.
It is also on a road where traders pass, coming and going,
because the defile is so narrow, that people cannot pass by
any other way; and the Infidels say that this bone is one
frysen<a name="FNanchor_a_44" id="FNanchor_a_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_44" class="fnanchor">1</a> in length, which is equal to an arrow’s flight, or
more. There, a toll is taken from traders; with the same,
they buy oil to anoint the bone that it may not rot. It is
not a long time since a king-sultan had a bridge built near
the bone; it is about two hundred years [ago], according to
an inscription on the bridge. When a lord comes there with
many people, he passes over the bridge, and does not pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>over the bone; but whoever wishes to pass over this wonder,
may do so, that he may say of it that in this country there
is an incredible thing, and which is nevertheless surely true.
And if it were not true, or had I not seen it, I would not
have spoken or written about it.<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_44" id="Footnote_a_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_44"><span class="label">1</span></a>Farsang or fursak = 3 m. 787-1/2 yds.</p></div>

<h2>45.—Of the many religions the Infidels have.</h2>

<p>It is to be noted, that the Infidels have five religions.
First, some believe in a giant called Aly, who was a great
persecutor of Christians. Others believe in one who was
called Molwa,<a name="FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> who was an Infidel priest. The third
believe, as the three kings believed, before they were
baptised. The fourth believe in fire, because they say that
Abel, the son of Adam, brought his offering to Almighty
God, and the flames of the fire were the offering; therefore
they believe in this offering. Among the fifth, some believe,
and the largest number among the Infidels believe, in one
who is called Machmet.</p>

<h2>46.—How Machmet and his religion appeared.</h2>

<p>It is here to be noted of Machmet, how he came and how
he brought his religion. Item, his father and mother were
poor people, and he is a native of Arabia. When he was
thirteen years old he went away from home, went to [some]
merchants who wanted to go to Egypt, and asked them to
take him with them. They took him, agreeing that he
must look after the camels and horses, and wherever Machmet
went, or stood, there stood always a cloud over him,
which was black; and when they came to Egypt, they encamped
near a village. Now at that time there were Christians
in Egypt; the pastor of the village came to the mer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>chants,
and invited them to dine with him. They did so,
and told Machmet that he must look after the horses and
camels. This he did. And now when they came into the
pastor’s house, the pastor asked them if they were all there?
The merchants said: “We are all here, except a boy who is
guarding our camels and horses.” Now this priest had read
in a prophecy, how one, born of two persons, would spread
a doctrine against that of Christianity, and that as a sign
who the man was to be, a black cloud would stand over
him. The pastor went out, and saw a black cloud over the
little boy, who was Machmet. When he had now seen him,
he asked the merchants that they should bring the boy;
they brought him. The pastor asked him his name. He
said, “Machmet”. This, the priest also found in prophecy,
and more [than this], that he would be a mighty lord and
man, and that he would greatly trouble Christianity; but
that his doctrine would not last one thousand years, and then
it would decrease. When the pastor knew that he was
named Machmet, and saw the black cloud stand over him,
he understood that he was the man who would introduce
this doctrine, and he placed him at his table above the
merchants, and showed him great honour. After the meal,
the pastor asked the merchants if they knew the boy. They
said; “No, but he came to us, and asked us to take him with us
into Egypt.” Then the pastor told them how he had read in a
prophecy, how this boy would introduce a doctrine against
Christians, through which they would suffer much, and for
a sign [of this], a black cloud would be always over him; and
showed them the cloud and said, that when he was in the
galley, the cloud was there also. He said to the boy: “Thou
shalt be a great teacher, and shalt introduce a particular
doctrine amongst the Infidels, and thou shalt overpower the
Christians by thy might, and thy descendants will also acquire
great power.<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> Now I pray thee that thou wilt
leave my race, the Armeny, in peace.” This he promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
him, and then went with the merchants to Babiloni, and became
a great scholar in Infidel writings, and preached to the
Infidels that they should believe in God who had created
heaven and earth, and not in the idols that were the creatures
of men; they have ears and hear not; they have eyes and
see not; they have a mouth and speak not; they have feet
and walk not; nor can they save either the body or soul;
and he converted the king of Babilony and many people
with him. Then the king took him, and gave him power
over the land; this he exercised; and when the king died,
he took the king’s wife, and became a mighty Calpha,
which is as much as to say, a Pope. He had four men
with him who were well learned in Infidel writings, and to
each he gave an office. To the first, he gave charge of ecclesiastical
jurisdiction; to the other, lay jurisdiction; the first,
was named Omar, the other, Otman; the third was named
Abubach, to whom he gave charge of weights and manufactures,
so that he was over them, and each one should be
faithful in his work. The fourth was named Aly; he made
him chief over all his people, and sent him into Arabia that
he should convert Christians, because Christians were there at
the time; but if any would not be converted, then he should
compel them by the sword. We read in the Infidel book,
Alkoray, that in one day ninety thousand men were killed
for [the sake of] Machmet’s doctrine, and the whole of
Arabia was converted. Machmet gave them a law, how they
were to conduct themselves before God, who had created
heaven and earth. And the law of the Infidels begins in
this way. First, when a boy was born, when he comes to
be thirteen years old, he must be circumcised, and he has
instituted five daily prayers, which must be daily repeated.
The first prayer is when the day breaks; another, in the
middle of the day; the third, at the time of vespers; the
fourth, before the sun goes down; the fifth, when day and
night part. With the first four, they praise God, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
made heaven and earth; with the fifth, they pray to Machmet,
that he will intercede for them with God. And they
must go into the temple at certain times of the day; and
when they want to go into the temple, they must wash the
mouth, then the hands, feet, ears, and eyes. And when any
one has sinned with his wife, he cannot go into the temple,
until he has washed his whole body; this they do in the
same belief as we Christians who confess; and the Infidels
believe that, after they have washed, they are as pure as
Christians, who, with full penitence, have confessed to the
priest. And when they want to enter the temple, they take
off their shoes and go in bare footed; they cannot take in
any arms, or weapons that cut, and they do not allow any
woman in the temple, so long as they are inside; and when
they go into the temple, they stand near each other, with
their hands close to each other; and they bend and kiss the
ground, and their priest sits on a seat before them, and
begins a prayer which they repeat after him. It is also to
be noted, that in the temple no one speaks to another,
nor looks at another, until the prayer is ended. In the
temple they do not put one foot far from the other, but
keep them close together; they do not go to and fro, nor
look here and there, but they stand still in one place, and
keep their hands together until they have quite finished
their prayer; and when they have quite finished, they bow
to each other, and only then go out of the temple. It is
also to be noted, that no door of the temple is left open.
They have no painting and no picture inside, only their
writings, plants, roses, and flowers. They do not willingly
allow Christians to enter, and more than this, it is to be
noted, that Infidels must not spit, cough, or do anything of
the sort in their temple; but if some one does so inside, he
must go out and wash himself, and, added to this, must
suffer much reproach from the Infidels; and when one
coughs, sneezes, or ..., he must go out of the temple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
wash himself after it. It is also to be noted, that they keep
Friday as we keep Sunday, and whoever does not go to the
temple on their holy-day, is taken and tied to a ladder, and
carried about the town from one street to the other, and tied
in front of the temple until their prayer is finished; and then
they beat him twenty-five times with a rod on the naked
body, whether he is rich or poor. Item, all the young
dropped by their cattle on the Friday, are given to the hospital.
Their priests also say, that when prayer is finished on
a holy-day, people may work, because work is holy, and
that man commits more sin by being idle than with work,
and therefore they allow their people to work on holy days
after they have finished their prayer. And when they finish
their prayers on holy-days, they raise their hands towards
God, and all pray with common voice for vengeance on
Christendom, and say: “Almighty God, we pray thee not to
suffer Christians to be united,” and say, that if Christians
are united and have peace amongst themselves, they must
succumb. It is also to be noted, that they have three
kinds of temples; one, to which they all go, is Sam, a parish
church; the other, into which priests go, is a monastery, and
in which they also go through their probation; the third,
is where their kings and mighty vassals have their burial,
and in it poor people are received for the love of God, whether
they be Christians, Infidels, or Jews, and the temple is
like a hospital. The first temple is also called Mesgit, the
other Medrassa, the third, Amarat.<a name="FNanchor_2_46" id="FNanchor_2_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_46" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> It is also to be noted,
that they do not bury their dead either in the temples, or
around them; they bury in the fields and on the high roads;
this they do that those who pass by, may pray to God for
them. And when one is about to die, they stand around him,
and tell him that he must think of God, and call to God to
have mercy upon him; and when he dies, they wash him, and
then their priests carry him, singing, to the grave, and bury
him. It is also to be noted, that the Infidels fast one month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
in the year, and this fast changes every year to another
month, and they fast one whole day without eating or drinking,
until they see the stars in the sky. Then the priest
goes up the tower, and calls the people to prayer, and they
go into the temple and say their prayers, and only when
they have finished their prayer, they go home and eat all
night until the morning, meat, or whatever they may have.
Also, they do not lay with their wives during their fast;
and when a woman is pregnant or in child-bed, she may eat
during the day, and the sick may do the same. They do
not take payment during fast, either for houses or for any
thing that pays interest.</p>

<h2>47.—Of the Infidels’ Easter-day.<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></h2>

<p>It is also to be noted of the Infidels’ Easter day, that, after
they have fasted four weeks, they have Easter for three days
following, and on the morning of Easter day they go to the
temple, and finish their prayer as is their custom; and when
they have done, the common people put on their arms, and
then come to the high priest’s house, with the chiefs of the
town and the soldiers, and then take out of the priest’s
house, the tabernacle, and ornament it with cloth of gold and
velvet, and the chiefs and the principal [people] carry it in
front of their temple, and in front of the tabernacle they carry
their banners, and all the musicians they can find also go
before it; and when they bring it to the temple, they put it
down, and the chief priest goes into the tabernacle and
preaches inside it. When he has preached, they put a sword
in his hand; he draws it and speaks to the people, and calls
upon God that he should give us might and strength against
all the enemies of Machmet’s faith, so that we may overcome
them with the sword. Then they all put out their hands, and
pray to our Lord that it may so happen, and after this, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
mighty lords go into the temple and pray, and during that
time, the people must guard the tabernacle and the lords.
When their prayer is finished, they take the tabernacle with
the priest inside, and carry him back to his house, with the
musicians and banners. Afterwards, they go to their houses
and have great rejoicings for three days.</p>

<h2>48.—Of the other Easter-day.</h2>

<p>And then, after a month, they have another Easter day in
honour of Abraham. On this [day] they kill lambs and
oxen, and give to the poor, by the will of God, [and] to the
honour of Abraham, because he was obedient, and wanted to
sacrifice his son to God. At this time, the Infidels go to the
grave of Machmet, and to the temple which Abraham built
and which lies in front of the city, and Machmet has his
grave in it, and it is called Madina. On Easter day the
king-sultan covers the temple of Abraham with velvet, which
is black, and then their priest cuts off a small piece for each
Infidel pilgrim that comes, that he may take it away as a
sign that he has been there.</p>

<h2>49.—Of the law of the Infidels.</h2>

<p>It is also here to be noted, what Machmet has forbidden
in the laws he has given to the Infidels. First, he has forbidden
the Infidels that they should dare to cut the beard,
because it would be against the will of God when he created
Adam, the first man, in his Divine image; and the Infidels
also say, that he who would have a face different to that he
received from God, does it against God’s command, whether
he be young or old. They also say that whoever cuts his
beard, he does it from vanity and pride, and to please the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
world, and scorns the creation of God; it is particularly the
Christians who do this to please their women, and this is a
great misfortune for them, because, for the sake of vanity,
they disfigure the image in which God created them. Then
Machmet forbade that any one should lift his hat or uncover
his head to another, whether he be king, emperor, noble or
plebeian, which they also observe; but when they go before
a mighty man, they bow and kneel before him. They say,
when one’s father, and mother, or another friend dies, they
should uncover the head before him. This they also do.
When they lament for one, they take off their hat, and
lift it high and throw it on the ground, and then they
lament. This also has Machmet allowed, that a man may
take as many wives as he can support. It is also their law,
that when a woman is pregnant, they do not go near her
until the child is born, nor for fourteen days after; but they
may have a concubine. The Infidels also say that after the
last day they will have wives, with whom they will lie; but
they will always remain virgins. They also say that God
has established marriage only for those who die in the faith
of Machmet. He has also ordered that they must not eat
any animal, or bird, unless they cut its throat and let the
blood flow, which they observe. They do not eat pig’s flesh,
because Machmet has also forbidden it.</p>

<h2>50.—Why Machmet has forbidden wine to Infidels.</h2>

<p>It is also to be noted, that Machmet has forbidden wine to
Infidels, because as the Infidels say: One day he was passing,
with his servants, a public-house, in which were many
people making merry. He asked why those people were so
merry; one of his servants told him it was caused by wine.
Machmet said: “Is it such a drink that people become so
merry from it!” Now in the evening Machmet went out again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and there was a great noise because a man and his wife
were fighting, and two persons were killed. He spoke and
asked what was the matter? One of his servants said that
the people who were merry have now lost their senses, because
they have taken too much wine, and they knew not
what they did. Then Machmet forbade wine to all, under a
heavy penalty, whether ecclesiastic or lay, emperor, king,
dukes, barons, counts, knight and varlet, servants, and all
those who were of his faith, and that they should no longer
drink wine, whether they be well or ill, and this is why he has
forbidden wine to them, as the Infidels have told me. He has
also ordered that the Christians and all those who are against
his faith, should be persecuted day and night, except the
Armeny who are to be free amongst them; and where there
are Armeny amongst them, then they should not take from
them a monthly tax greater than two pfennings, because
Machmet had promised the Armenian priest, as has been
stated. He has also ordered, that when they overcome Christians,
they should not kill them; but they should pervert
them, and should thus spread and strengthen their own
faith.</p>

<h2>51.—Of a fellowship the Infidels have among themselves.</h2>

<p>It is also to be noted, that during the time he was on
earth, Machmet had forty disciples. They have a special
fellowship and have made an alliance against Christendom,
and this is their law. Whoever wants to be of their fellowship,
must swear that if he meets a Christian, he will not
let him live nor take him a prisoner, whether from favour
or for the sake of profit; and if it should happen that in a
battle which Infidels [might] have with Christians, he cannot
succeed to take one, he must buy a Christian and
kill him. Those who are in this fellowship are called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
They;<a name="FNanchor_a_51" id="FNanchor_a_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_51" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_51" id="FNanchor_1_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_51" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> there are many of them in Turkey, and they
always go against the Christians because it is their law.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_51" id="Footnote_a_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_51"><span class="label">1</span></a>To those who are unfamiliar with the name, the title of Ghasi
would scarcely be recognised in that of They. <i>N.</i></p></div>

<h2>52.—How a Christian becomes an Infidel.</h2>

<p>It is also to be noted how a Christian, from the beginning,
becomes an Infidel. When a Christian wants to become an
Infidel, he must before all men raise a finger, and say the
words: “La il lach illallach;” Machmet is his true messenger.<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
And when he says this, they take him to the high
priest; then he must repeat the above written words before
the priest, and must deny the Christian faith, and when he has
done that, they put on him a new dress, and the priest binds
a new kerchief on his head; and this they do that it may be
seen he is an Infidel, because Christians wear blue kerchiefs,
and the Jews, yellow kerchiefs, on the head. Then the
priest asks all the people to put on their armour, and who
has to ride, rides; also all the priests who are in the neighbourhood.
And when the people come, they put him on a
horse, and then the common people must ride before him,
and the priests go behind him, with trumpets, cymbals and
fifes, and two priests ride near him; and so they lead him
about in the town; and the Infidels cry with a loud voice
and praise Machmet, and the two priests say to him these
words: “Thary wirdur, Messe chulidur, Maria cara baschidur,
Machmet kassuldur”: which is as much as to say;
There is one God, and the Messiah his servant, Mary his
maid, and Machmet his chief messenger.<a name="FNanchor_2_52" id="FNanchor_2_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_52" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> After they have
led him everywhere in the city, from one street to another,
then they lead him into the temple and circumcise him. If he
is poor, they make a large collection and give it to him, and
the great lords shew particular honour to him, and make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>him rich; this they do, that Christians may be more willing
to be converted to their faith. <em>If it is a woman who wants
to change her religion</em>,<a name="FNanchor_a_52" id="FNanchor_a_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_52" class="fnanchor">1</a> she is also taken to the high priest,
and must say the above words. The priest then takes the
woman’s girdle, cuts it in two, and makes of it a cross; on
this, the woman must stamp three times,<a name="FNanchor_b_52" id="FNanchor_b_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_b_52" class="fnanchor">2</a> deny the Christian
faith, and must say the other words above written. The
Infidels have a good custom among their merchants, when
one wants to buy from another, whatever be the merchandise.
The buyer says to the seller, that he should make a
just profit on what he buys, so that he also might live; so
that he takes no more profit than one pfenning in forty
pfennings, which is equal to one gulden in forty guldens,
and no more; this they call a right purchase and profit, and
this Machmet has also commanded them, so that the poor,
like the rich, might live. The priests also always say in
their sermons, that they should help each other and be subject
to their superiors, and the rich are to be humble before
the poor, and when they do this, God Almighty gives them
strength and might against their enemies; and whatever
their priest says to them about spiritual things, they are
obedient and submissive to it. This is the faith of Machmet
which he has given to the Infidels as his law, such as it is,
as I then heard it from them.</p>

<h2>53.—What the Infidels believe of Christ.</h2>

<p>It is also to be noted, that the Infidels believe that Jesus
was born of a virgin, and that after the birth, she remained
a virgin. They also believe that when Jesus was born, he
spoke to his mother and comforted her, and they believe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>Jesus is the highest prophet of God amongst all prophets,
and that he has never committed sin; and they do not believe
that Jesus was crucified, but that it was another who
was like him; therefore Christians have a wicked faith, because
they say that Jesus was crucified, who was the highest
friend of God, and has never committed any sin, therefore
God would not have been a just judge if Jesus was crucified
and innocent. And when one converses with them of the
Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, they say that they are
three persons, and not one God, because their book Alkaron
says nothing of the Trinity. When anybody says that Jesus
is the word of God, they say, this we do know, that the
word of God has spoken, otherwise he would not be God;
and when one says that wisdom is the Son of God who was
born of the Virgin Mary, from a word which the angels announced
to her, and on account of which word we must all rise
and come to judgment; they say it is true that no one can go
against the word of God. They also say that the strength of
the word of God cannot be conceived by any one, and therefore
their book Alkoran says, and gives them a sign, by the
word which the angel spoke to Mary, that Jesus was born
of the word of God. They say that Abraham was the friend
of God, Moyses the prophet of God, Jesus the word of God,
so was Machmet the true messenger of God. They also say,
that Jesus, of the four, was the most worthy, and was the
highest with God, and it will be he also who will judge the
last judgment of God over all men.</p>

<h2>54.—What the Infidels say of the Christians.</h2>

<p>The Infidels also say that whatever territory they possess
of the Christians, they do not owe it to their power, nor to
their wisdom, nor to their holiness, but they have it because
of the injustice, perversity, and arrogance which Christians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
have against them; therefore Almighty God has decreed,
that they should take the land from Christians, because they
do not conduct their affairs, whether spiritual or temporal,
with justice, because they look to wealth and favour, and
the rich treat the poor with haughtiness, and do not help
them either with gifts or with justice, and do not hold to
the doctrine which the Messiah has given them. They also
say, that they find it and read it in their prophecies, that the
Christians will yet expel them out of the country, and will
again possess the country; but so long as Christians are
such, and are perverse, and their spiritual and temporal lords
live such a disordered life, we are not afraid that they will
expel us out of our country; because we fear God, and do
always what is right and just, and worthy, according to our
faith, for the love of God and in honour of our prophet
Machmet, who is the highest messenger of God, who has
given us the right doctrine by his teaching; to him we are
obedient, and always willingly follow his commandments
which are in the book called the Alkoran, which has been
touched upon often before.</p>

<h2>55.—How Christians are said not to hold to their
religion.</h2>

<p>The Infidels also say that Christians do not hold to the
commandment, nor to the doctrine of the Messiah, which
the Messiah has commanded them, and they also do not
observe the law of the book Inzil, which is called Ewangely,
nor the rules which stand in that book. They hold to particular
laws, spiritual and temporal, which are against the
laws of the book Inzil, and the commandments and laws
contained therein are all holy and just; but the law and belief
which they have set up and invented, are all false and
unjust, because the laws which they have made are for pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>fit
and favour, which is all against God and his dear prophets;
and whatever misfortunes and troubles they have, are all
decreed to them by God for their unrighteousness.</p>

<h2>56.—How long ago it is since Machmet lived.</h2>

<p>Item, it is to be noted, that the time Machmet was born
counts from Christ’s birth, six hundred and nine years, and
the Infidels say, that on the day he was born, one thousand
and one churches fell of themselves, and that happened as a
sign of the injury he would do to Christianity in his time.
It is also here to be noted, how many tongues there are in
the Greek faith. The first is the Greek tongue, in which
their books are written; the Turks call them Vrrum. The
other is the Rivssen tongue, which the Infidels call Orrust.
The third, Pulgery, which the Infidels call Wulgar. The
fourth, the Winden tongue, which they call Arnaw.<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
The fifth, the Walachy tongue, which the Infidels call
Vfflach. The sixth, the Yassen tongue, which the Infidels
call Afs.<a name="FNanchor_2_56" id="FNanchor_2_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_56" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> The seventh, the Kuthia tongue, which the
Infidels call Thatt.<a name="FNanchor_a_56" id="FNanchor_a_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_56" class="fnanchor">1</a> The eighth, the Sygun, which the
Infidels call Ischerkas. The ninth, Abukasen, and the Infidels
call them Appkas. The tenth tongue, Gorchillas, and
the Infidels call them Kurtzi. The eleventh, the Megrellen
tongue, also so called by the Infidels. Item, between the
Zurian and Greek faith, there is but one difference, therefore
they say the Schurian tongue is also of their faith; but
the Schurians are of Jacob, and have the faith of Saint
Jacob, and have it that each must make the wafer with his
own hands, into which God’s body will be changed. And
when he has made the paste, he takes a hair from his beard
and puts it in the wafer, and changes it into God’s body.
And there is a great difference between what the Greek and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>what the Schurian priest reads, or sings, in the church, because
it is the Schurian and not the Greek tongue.<a name="FNanchor_3_56" id="FNanchor_3_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_56" class="fnanchor">(3)</a></p>

<h2>57.—Of Constantinoppel.</h2>

<p>Constantinoppel is a fine large city and well built, and is
quite ten Italian miles in extent at its walls, about which it
has fifteen hundred towers. The city is triangular, having
the sea on two sides. The Greeks call Constantinoppel,
Istimboli, but the Turks call it Stampol; and opposite to
the city, is a city called Pera, which the Greeks call Kalathan,
and the Infidels call it the same.<a name="FNanchor_1_57" id="FNanchor_1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_57" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> Between the
two cities is an arm of the sea, quite three Italian miles in
length, and half or more in breadth; and the arm
is crossed from each side, because the distance by land is
far. The said city belongs to Genaw. The great Alexander
cut through high rocks and mountains fifteen Italian miles in
length, and caused two seas to flow into each other;<a name="FNanchor_2_57" id="FNanchor_2_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_57" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> and
that which flows is called and is the Great Sea, and it is also
called the Black Sea, and the Tunow and many other great
rivers flow into it. In the said sea one goes to Caffa, to
Alathena, to Trabessanda, and to Samson, and to many
other cities and countries that lay around. The arm of the
sea [at] Constantinoppel is called Hellespant by the Greeks,
and the Infidels call it Poges. The Turks also have a shore
across the sea, opposite to Constantinople, which they call
Skuter; there, the Turks cross the sea. Also not far from
Constantinoppel by the sea, was Troya, on a fine plain, and
one can still see where the city stood.<a name="FNanchor_3_57" id="FNanchor_3_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_57" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> The emperor of
Constantinoppel has two palaces in the city; one is very
beautiful, and is much decorated inside with gold, lapis-lazuli,
and marbles. In front of the palace is a fine square
for tilting, and for all [kinds of] pastime that might be desired
in front of the palace.<a name="FNanchor_4_57" id="FNanchor_4_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_57" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> In front of the palace is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
the statue of the emperor Justian on a horse; it is placed
upon a high piece of marble, which is a pillar. I asked a
burgher of the city of what this statue was made; he told
me it was of bronze, and that both the horse and the man
was entirely of one casting. Some people of the country
say that it is of leather, and yet it must have stood there
quite a thousand years; had it been leather, it would not
have stood so long, it would have rotted. At one time the
statue had a golden apple in the hand, and that meant that
he had been a mighty emperor over Christians and Infidels;
but now he has no longer that power, so the apple has disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_5_57" id="FNanchor_5_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_57" class="fnanchor">(5)</a></p>

<h2>58.—Of the Greeks.</h2>

<p>Not far from Constantinoppel there is an island called
Lemprie; in it is a mountain that is so high, it reaches to
the clouds.<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> At Constantinoppel is the most beautiful
church, so that nothing like it can be found in India; it is
called Sancta Sophya, and is covered all over with lead, and
one can see one’s self on the walls inside the church as if in
a mirror, because the marble and lapis-lazuli on the wall is
clear and clean. In this same church is their patriarch with
his priests, and the Greeks and all those who are under the
patriarch go in pilgrimage, as we, for our sins, go to Rome.
When Constantine had finished the churches, he placed as
an improvement in the church, high up in the middle of the
dome, five golden discs, and each disc is as wide, large, and
thick as a mill-stone;<a name="FNanchor_2_58" id="FNanchor_2_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_58" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> but the emperor took down two during
the great war which the Turkish king Wyasit had with
him, when he besieged Constantinoppel for seven years. I myself
was at that same time with the king in Turkey,<a name="FNanchor_3_58" id="FNanchor_3_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_58" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> and I
have also seen the three discs [left] in the church. The church
of Sancta Sophia has three hundred gates, which are all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
brass. I was <span class="smcap">III</span> months at Constantinoppel in the house of
the patriarch, but I and my comrades were not allowed to
walk about the city, because they were afraid that the Infidels
would recognise us, and would take us before the emperor.
I would gladly have seen it (the city), but it could
not be, because the emperor had forbidden it, but even then
we sometimes went out with the patriarch’s servants.</p>

<h2>59.—Of the Greek religion.</h2>

<p>It is to be noted, that the Greeks do not believe in the
Holy Trinity; they do not believe in the Chair at Rome, nor
in the Pope. They say that their patriarchs have as much
power as the Pope at Rome. The sacrament they make of
leavened bread, and take it with wine and warm water; and
when the priest changes the body of God, they all fall
down on their faces and say: “No man is worthy to look at
God.” And when the priest has finished the Mass, he takes
the bread that remains, of which he had prepared the sacrament,
and cuts it into small pieces on a dish, and then men
and women sit down. Then the priest or his assistant takes
the bread round, and so every one takes a piece and eats it,
and this bread they call prossura. This bread is not baked
by any man or woman, only by a virgin or a nun. They
also give the sacrament to young children, but they do not
give the sacred oil to any body; and they also say that nobody
is wise, and that no one goes into heaven or hell before
the day of judgment; then each man will go into heaven
or into hell as he has deserved. They have no Mass, unless
it is asked for. They say that only one Mass is to be celebrated
at the same altar in the day, and they do not let Mass
be said at their altars in Latin, and Mass must not be said in
any language but in the Greek language, because the Greek
language is of their faith. They say also that their faith is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
the true Christian faith, and the others are not true. They
also have the Mass on feast days only, and not on week days,
because all their priests are craftsmen and must work, and
all have wives and children, and their priests take one wife
only; and when she dies he cannot take any more, either in
marriage or otherwise. If he has anything to do with a
woman, and the bishop becomes aware of it, he takes away
from him his priestly charge, so that he cannot say the Mass
any more. And when a bishop consecrates a priest, he girds
him with a girdle, and when the priest does anything
against his priestly order, the bishop takes away the girdle,
so that he cannot say Mass any more, and is fallen from his
office. The best and the richest marry the priests, and
when they are in a house, the priests’ wives sit at the upper
[end] of the table, and when women walk together, the
priests’ wives go first. Their churches are not independent.
When a man builds a church and dies, his heirs inherit the
church like other property, and sell it as any other house.
They say, it is not a sin to have to do with unmarried
women, because it is not a deadly sin, as it is natural. They
also say, that when one takes a monthly profit of two pfennings
for one hundred pfennings, it is goodly gain, and not
usury. On Wednesdays, they do not eat meat; and so, on
Friday, they eat fish and oil only, and say that Saturday is
not a fast-day, and one may well eat meat on that day. In
the churches, the women stand separately, and neither men
nor women dare to go near the altar. And when they make
[the sign of] a cross, they do it with the left hand. And
when one is about to die, they baptise him again, and there
are many who are baptised every year. They have no font
in their churches; and when their bishop stands in the
choir, he stands in the middle of the church and in the
choir, and the priests stand around him. Their bishop eats
no meat throughout the year, and during the fasts he eats
no fish nor anything that has blood, and all their clergy do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the same. When they baptise a child, they have <span class="smcap">X</span> or more
godfathers; men and women bring to the child a christening
shirt or a candle. They also say, that our priests sin if they
have a Mass every day, because they cannot always be worthy.
They also say, that our priests commit mortal sin when they
shave their beard, because it is not godly, because it happens
from unchastity, and to please the women. And when one
dies, and prayers for the dead are sung for him, boiled wheat
to eat is given to the priests and to the people, after an
old usage, and this same wheat they call coleba. They
wash their dead before they bury them. Their priests sell
and buy like other merchants. They fast during Lent for
fifty days; and the priests and the laity also fast forty days
in Advent, and for the twelve holy apostles they fast thirty
days; they also fast fifteen days for our Lady’s Assumption;
they have only three days in the year for our Lady,
because they do not keep Candlemas. Item, the Greeks do
not keep the resurrection of Jhesus xpi at the same time
with us; they keep it on the next Friday after Easter.
Then they sing Xristos anesti, which is as much as to say,
Xristus is risen.<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">(1)</a></p>

<h2>60.—How the city of Constantinoppel was built.</h2>

<p>It is also to be noted, that the emperor of Constantinoppel
himself creates the patriarchs, and also gives all
God’s gifts to the church, and is lord of spiritual and temporal
matters as far as his territory reaches. I have heard
much and often from their learned men, that Saint Constantine
came from Rome with many kocken and galleys to
Greece, to the place where Constantinoppel lies, and then there
appeared to him an angel from God, who said to him: “Here
must thy dwelling be; now sit on the horse, and do not look
back, and ride to the place from which thou hast begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
ride.” He mounted, and rode quite half a day; and when at
night he arrived at the same place where he had mounted,
he looked back, and saw a wall of the height of a man spring
up from the ground; and from the place where he had
looked back, to the place from which he had begun to ride,
which is quite twenty paces or more, there was no wall; it
has been much tried to build a wall, but it will not stand;
but it goes towards the sea, so that they can defend themselves
better than if it had been towards the land. I have
seen it, because in the same place there is a breakwater,<a name="FNanchor_a_60" id="FNanchor_a_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_60" class="fnanchor">1</a><a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
therefore the Greeks say that the said wall was built by
angels; and that the crown with which their emperor is
crowned, and which was brought to Saint Constantine by
an angel from heaven, is a heavenly crown; and therefore
there is no worthier nor more highly born emperor than the
emperor of Constantinoppel. And when a priest dies, they
put on him everything that belongs to a priest at the altar,
and they put him on a seat in the grave, and cover him with
earth. The chant, Ayos otheos, which they sing once a
year only, they sing upon all other holy occasions; and
during Lent they sing the Alleluia every day, when they
are in church. They sing Kirieleyson only, in their Mass,
and not Xreleyson. They say, there is but one Godhead
and no difference, that it is God the Father and God the
Son, and therefore it would not be right to sing Christ.
They also bow very humbly before their priests. When a
layman meets a priest, he takes off his hat, and bows
humbly, and says: “Esloy mena tespotha”; which is as
much as to say: Bless me, Lord. Then the priest lays
his hand on the layman’s head and says: “Otheos efflon
essenam”; and that means, God bless thee; and this they do
always, men and women, when they meet a priest. When
a priest takes a wife, he takes her before he becomes a
priest; the reason is, because if he does not beget a child,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>he cannot be a priest, but so soon as he has got a child, he
is consecrated to be a priest. Laymen pray only with the
Pater Noster, and do not know the Belief nor the Ave
Maria. Many priests wear white garments at Mass.<a name="FNanchor_2_60" id="FNanchor_2_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_60" class="fnanchor">(2)</a></p>

<h2>61.—How the Jassen have their marriages.</h2>

<p>Inter illas gentes, Gargetter et Jassen, nuptiæ explentur
hac conditione, videlicet mater puellam suam intactam
esse asserit, sed ni reapse sit virgo, conjugium non
conficitur. Quando igitur de nuptiis agitur, cantibus comitantur
puellam ante thalamum, et ibi se ponere jubent;
succedit inde sponsus cum adolescentulis, et gladio stricto
percutit thalamum, et prope illum se se ponit una cum adolescentulis,
et comedunt et bibunt, et se oblectant inter
choreas et cantus. Et quum ita solatia cesserint, sponsum
denudant usque ad subuculam suam, et egredientes relinquunt
cum sponsa. Postea venit sponsi frater, et nonnullus ex
amicis intimis, et ante ostium excubat stricto ense; et quum
sponsus sponsam virginem non invenit, hoc matri ejus palam
facit. Deinde mater sponsi cum amicis suis ante thalamum
adstat, observant panniculos, et si nullum virginitatis signum
inveniunt, omnes incipiunt se contristare; quum vero
pater et mater sponsi cum amicis suis mane adveniunt, ut
festa conjugalia concelebrent, mater sponsi manu regit poculum
in una parte perforatum, et implet vino claudens foramen
digito, et inde matrem sponsæ invitat ut libat amovens
digitum e foramine, et sic vinum extra fluit; tum mater
sponsi dicit matri sponsæ: Ita evenit de filia tua. Hoc
summo dedecori est parentibus sponsæ, quam tradunt eis
ut secum ducant, dicentes, se velle nubere filis intactam
puellam, sed non ita evenisse de eorum filia. Then come
their priests and the chief [persons] that are there, and invite
the bridegroom’s father and mother, and then they go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
to their son the bridegroom, and ask him whether or no he
will have her? If he says, “Yes”, she is given to him by
the priests, and the other persons who have interceded for
her. But if he says, “No”, then they are in all things
separated; and whatever he has brought to her, she gives
the whole back to him; and whatever clothes he has given
her, she must give back to him; after which, he can take
another wife, and she another husband.<a name="FNanchor_1_61" id="FNanchor_1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_61" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> There are many
people in Ermenia, who have this custom. The Infidels
call the Gorgiten, Kurtzi; and the Jassen they call Affs.</p>

<h2>62.—Of Armenia.</h2>

<p>I have also been a great deal in Armenia. After Tämerlin
died, I came to his son, who has two kingdoms in
Armenia. He was named Scharoch; he liked to be in Armenia,
because there is a very beautiful plain. He remained
there in the winter with his people, because there was
good pasturage. A great river runs through the plain; it
is called the Chur, and it is also called the Tygris; and
near this river, in this same country, is the best silk. The
Infidels call the plain, in the Infidel tongue, Karawag.<a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
The Infidels possess it all, and yet it stands in Ermenia.
There are also Armenians in the villages, but they must
pay tribute to the Infidels. I always lived with the Armenians,
because they are very friendly to the Germans, and
because I was a German they treated me very kindly; and
they also taught me their Pater Noster and their language,
and they call the Germans, Nymitsch.<a name="FNanchor_2_62" id="FNanchor_2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_62" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> In Armenia are
three kingdoms; one is called Tiffliss, the other is called Syos,
the third is called Ersingen; the Armenians call it Isingkan,
and that is Lesser Armenia. They also possessed
Babylon for a long time; but they now have it no longer. The
son of Tämerlin had Tyfflis and Ersing at the time that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
was there. Sifs belonged to the king-sultan, and was won,
counting from Christ’s birth, twelve hundred and seventy-seven
years; then did the sultan of Alkenier conquer it.<a name="FNanchor_3_62" id="FNanchor_3_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_62" class="fnanchor">(3)</a></p>

<h2>63.—Of the religion of the Armenians.</h2>

<p>The Armenians believe in the Holy Trinity. I have also
often heard their priests preach in their churches, when I
had gone to Mass, and been in their churches, that Saint
Bartlome and Saint Thaten of the twelve holy apostles, converted
them to the Christian faith, but that they have often
been perverted again. There was a holy man named
Gregory, and the king of Armenia was his cousin, and he
lived in the time when Saint Silvester was Pope at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_1_63" id="FNanchor_1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_63" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
The king of Armenia died, and he was a good Christian, and
his son was king, and he was named Derthatt; he was very
strong, because he had the strength of forty oxen; what they
could drag and lift, that he could lift alone. It was this same
king who built the large church at Bethleen, as has been
already stated.<a name="FNanchor_a_63" id="FNanchor_a_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_63" class="fnanchor">1</a>
<a name="FNanchor_2_63" id="FNanchor_2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_63" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> And when he became king after his father,
he turned Infidel, and persecuted the Christians, and took
hold of his cousin Gregory, and told him he must worship
his idol. This the blessed man would not do, so he put him
into a pit where there were adders and serpents and many
other hurtful reptiles, that they might eat him. But they did
nothing to him. He lay there twelve years. About the
same time, several saintly maidens came to Ermenia from
Italy, and preached the Christian religion instead of the
Ermenen religion. The king heard this, and ordered that
they should be brought to him. There was one amongst
them who was named Susanna, who was very beautiful;
she was taken to his room, when he wished to urge her to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>unchastity, but strong as he was, he could do nothing with
the young woman, nor win her with all his power, for God
was with her. This was told to him in the prison, and he
said: “Oh, the wicked pig!” At the same time, the king
fell from his throne, became a pig, and ran away to the
woods. Then there was great disorder in the land, but the
vassals of the country consulted, and took Gregory out of
the pit, and asked him if he could help the king. He
answered them and said, that he would not help him, unless
they and he became Christians. The vassals promised him
this, also for the king. Then said Gregory: “Ride into the
wood, look for him, and bring him.” They rode into the
wood, and brought him to Gregory; and as soon as he saw
Gregory, he ran to him, and kissed his feet. Gregory knelt
on his knees, and prayed to Almighty God that he would
have mercy on the man, and make him whole. The king
again became a man, and was, with all his people, again a
Christian,<a name="FNanchor_3_63" id="FNanchor_3_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_63" class="fnanchor">(3)</a> and went against Babiloni and the Infidels,
and conquered Babilonia and the whole country, three kingdoms,
and converted them to Christianity, and appointed
Gregory over the clergy and all ecclesiastical orders. In
this way, their religion was established by the King Derthat
and the man Gregory.<a name="FNanchor_4_63" id="FNanchor_4_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_63" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> They also took much territory that
belonged to the Infidels, and forced them to Christianity by
means of the sword; but now they have lost all their kingdoms,
although they are a fighting people. It is not long
since they lost a kingdom, and a good capital called Siss;
it was taken by the king-sultan. It is also their patriarch’s
seat, but he must pay great tribute to the sultan. The
king of Zypern has many nobles of Armenia at his court,
because it is near. Then was Gregory told of the great
miracle which Pope Silvester had performed on Constantine,
during the time that he was emperor at Rome, because
he had made him clean of an eruption, and that he
had saved from death the children that had been brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
together to be killed, because the doctors informed the emperor
that he should wash in the blood of children, so that
he might get well of his eruptions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_a_63" id="Footnote_a_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_a_63"><span class="label">1</span></a>No such previous statement appears either in the Heidelberg MS.
or in Penzel.</p></div>

<h2>64.—Of a Saint Gregory.</h2>

<p>Gregory thought over it, and said to the king: “The power
that thou has conferred upon me, has no influence, unless I
have it from the holy father Silvester”; and he told the king
of the great miracle performed by the holy father on the
emperor Constantine. The king said that he would willingly
see him, and would go with him, and prepared and
made arrangements for [the government of] his kingdom.
He took with him forty thousand men, good horsemen and
foot-soldiers; he also took with him many valuables and
many precious stones, with which to do honour to the holy
father, Saint Silvester.<a name="FNanchor_1_64" id="FNanchor_1_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_64" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> Gregory took with him the most
learned men that he had under him, and went from Babiloni
through Persia, through Greater Armenia, and through
many other countries, and went through the Iron Gates
which lie between two seas, and reach into Great Tartary
towards Ruwschea; through Walchi, Pulgeri, through Ungeren,
Frigaul, through Lamparten, through Duschkan, and
so they came dry-footed to Rome, as they had not passed over
the sea. And when they were near Rome, Silvester sent
to them all the blind, lame, and sick, that Gregory might
heal them, as he wished to test his sanctity. When the
king, Derthat, saw the people, he was angry, and thought
the Pope was making fun of him. Gregory, without being
angry, said: “I know well what he means”; and ordered
that water should be brought to him; and he knelt on his
knees, and prayed to Almighty God that those who will be
sprinkled with the water, will become sound. He then
took a sponge on a stick, and sprinkled the people with it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and he who was touched by it, was healed. The blind received
sight. The Pope, Silvester, heard of this, and went
with all his clergy, and with the whole city of Rome, to
meet him, and shewed him deference and honour. They
were a whole year going by land, from Babilony to Rome.
Gregory asked the Pope Silvester to give him power to free
his clergy and his people from the jurisdiction of Rome,
because he was so far that he could not always go to the
Chair; then he gave him the power of a patriarch, and whoever
wished to have this power, could not obtain it elsewhere
than at Rome, and would have to send an embassy
to Rome every three years. This he vowed to him, and
arranged that all those who were of his faith, ecclesiastical
or lay, should be subject to the Chair at Rome, and whoever
would not be so, should be under the ban of the Pope, be
he bishop, lord, or menial, rich or poor, in his land, and this
oath the king and all his knights also took. This lasted
three hundred years after the time of Gregory, that they
were subject to the Chair, after which they no longer went
to the Chair, and themselves chose a patriarch. Their
patriarch they call Kathagnes, and a king they call Takchauer.<a name="FNanchor_2_64" id="FNanchor_2_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_64" class="fnanchor">(2)</a></p>

<h2>65.—Of a dragon and a unicorn.</h2>

<p>There was also at that same time on a mountain near
Rome, a dragon and a unicorn, that did much harm to the
people in the streets, so that none could pass. Then the
holy father, Saint Silvester, asked the king of Armenia, as
he was a powerful man, whether he would not try, with
God’s will, to kill the dragon and also the unicorn; the
king went alone, and saw where they were, and when he
got there, he saw them biting each other, and he looked at
them until the dragon escaped, and the unicorn chased him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
to a hole in the rock; the dragon turned himself in the
hole, and defended himself against the unicorn. The unicorn
struck at the dragon with his tongue, and tried to
draw him outside. The dragon seized the unicorn, and they
struggled together, until the unicorn pulled the dragon out
as far as his neck, and the one would not let the other go.
At that moment, the king ran up and cut the dragon’s
neck, and with the tugging that the unicorn gave it, the
head rolled down the rock; the king then sprang up and
killed the unicorn also. He then returned to Rome, and
ordered that the heads should be brought; now the waggon
had enough to do to carry the head of the dragon; and so
the King Derthat delivered the Romans of the reptiles, for
which the city, and especially the holy father, shewed him
great honour. Then Gregory went to the Pope, and asked
him for the articles which belonged to the faith, which he
gave him, and then they returned to their own country, and
Gregory taught the Christian faith as he received it from
the Pope, which they do not hold any more, as is above
stated.<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> Now, they themselves elect their patriarch, and
when they wish to make one, twelve bishops and four archbishops
must be present, and he is elected. Many of the
articles that Gregory brought from Rome, have been
changed, and they are now separated from the church of
Rome. Their priests make the sacrament with unleavened
bread, and nobody else prepares the bread, but the priest
who is to celebrate the Mass, and he prepares one only.
Whilst he is making it, other priests must read the psalter
right through, and if there are no priests, then he must say
it himself, right through.<a name="FNanchor_2_65" id="FNanchor_2_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_65" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> They say that it is a great
sin that a man or woman should make the bread for the
Holy Sacrament; they also say that it is not right to sell
this bread like other bread. They communicate the Holy
Sacrament with wine, and not with water. When they
want to have the Mass, they all stand together, and none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
communicate until he who is at the high altar has communicated,
so that they all communicate together. They also
read the gospel [looking] towards the rising of the sun,
and whichever priest celebrates the Mass, does not dare to
sleep that day after midnight; and for three nights previously,
and one night after, he must separate himself from
his wife. They do not allow any deacon or any of a lower
grade to be at the altar, only the priest; and no man or
woman can attend the Mass unless they have confessed;
and no woman can go into the church whilst she is unwell.
Whoever has hatred or enmity towards another, must stand
before the church, and is not allowed to go in until he has
become reconciled. Woman and man sing the Pater Noster
and the Belief, with the priest, when he celebrates the
Mass. They give the Sacrament also to young children.
The priests do not shave their hair nor their beard. Instead
of consecrated oil, they have balm, and the patriarch
gives the sultan a large price for the balm, which he sends
to his bishopric. When one wants to be a priest, he must
be forty days and nights in the church; and when the XL
days are passed, he sings his first Mass, and he is led out
with singing, dressed for the Mass. Then come his wife
and child, and they kneel before him, and he gives them
his blessing; then come the priest’s friends and those of
his wife, and they bring their offerings; also those who
are invited; and there is great rejoicing in his honour,
more even than when he was married, but he cannot be
with his wife until he has said the Mass for forty days in
succession. When they baptise a child, a man receives it,
not a woman, because they say that our Lord had only a
man to baptise him, and not a woman. It is also a great
sin to take a woman to a baptism. They hold baptism in
great honour, and whoever comes into the presence of his
godfather, must kneel on the ground before him. They
hold, that in sponsorship, marriage is forbidden to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
fourth generation. They place much confidence in our religion;<a name="FNanchor_3_65" id="FNanchor_3_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_65" class="fnanchor">(3)</a>
they also willingly go to Mass in our churches,
which the Greeks do not. They say, that between their religion
and ours, there is only a hair’s breadth, but that
there is a great division between the Greek and their religion.
During the week, they fast on Wednesday and on
Friday. They do not fast in Advent, and may eat oil, but
on those days they eat as often as they like after mid-day.
They fast one week for Saint Gregory. They have a saint
named Aurencius,<a name="FNanchor_4_65" id="FNanchor_4_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_65" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> who was a doctor, for whom they also
fast one week. They fast also on the day of the Holy Cross,
which is in September; they fast also one week for Saint
James the Great;<a name="FNanchor_5_65" id="FNanchor_5_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_65" class="fnanchor">(5)</a> and they fast <span class="smcap">XV</span> days in August, for
our dear Lady. They fast one week for the three holy
kings. They have a saint who was a knight; his name is
Zerlichis;<a name="FNanchor_6_65" id="FNanchor_6_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_65" class="fnanchor">(6)</a> they call upon him loudly when they are at
war or in other necessity; they fast one week for him.
There are many knights and nobles who fast for him for three
days in January, so that they do not eat or drink, because
he is a great helper in need. Their saints’ days they keep
on Saturday. On Easter eve, they celebrate the Mass after
vespers, because that is about the time when the light
shines on the holy sepulchre at Jherusalem. They also
celebrate Easter, Trinity, and Ascension day with us; the
other holy days they keep separately. Christmas and the
Epiphany they keep at one and the same time, and on that
evening, after vespers, they have the Mass. They say, that
God was born on that day, and was baptised thirty years
after, on that same day, and therefore they keep Christ’s
birth and his baptism on the same day, and that is the sixth
of January. They fast one week for the twelve holy apostles,
and keep their feast-day one day only, and that is Saturday.
They pray with the Ave Maria once a year only, and this
they do upon our Lady’s day in Lent, which they do not hold
as we do.<a name="FNanchor_7_65" id="FNanchor_7_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_65" class="fnanchor">(7)</a> When two married persons quarrel with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
other, and the one will not have the other, they are separated
at bed and board; but, if neither wishes to have the other,
they are separated so that each can take another spouse.
If they have any children, they are given to the father.
Their churches are all free, as no one can inherit or sell
them. When a priest wants to build a church with his
own money, he must give it to the parish, so that after his
death no one may dispose of it, or he is not allowed to build
it; and the same if a lord or layman builds one, so that nobody
shall interfere, because it has been the custom amongst
them. When a priest or layman founded a church, his
heirs inherited it as they did his other property, and let it
out on usury, or sold it like other property. This they have
changed, and will not allow it any more, and say that every
house of God should be free. Their priests go to matins
every night,<a name="FNanchor_a_65" id="FNanchor_a_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_a_65" class="fnanchor">1</a> which the Greek priests do not. They allow the
prayers for the dead to be said for their rich people during
their lifetime, and say that it is better to light a candle with
one’s own hand, than to let another person light it, by
which they mean that he who does not care for his soul in
his lifetime, will scarcely be cared for by his friends afterwards,
because the friends get the money and do not care
for the soul. They say, that when a man himself does good
to his own soul, it is agreeable to God. When a poor man
dies without confessing or without [having received] the
body of God, a place in the churchyard is obtained for him
by his advocate, and they lay him in the churchyard, and
place a large stone on the grave, and write on it the name
of God and the name of the dead man who lies there, and
this they do for a sign that he is dead. And when a bishop
or priest dies, they dress him as he stands before the altar,
and the priests make his grave, then carry him out of the
church, and put him on a seat in the grave. The first day
they bury him up to his girdle, and go every day to the
grave, and sing and read the psalter over him, and each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>priest throws a spadeful of earth over him, and this they
do every day until the eighth day, and then they bury him
altogether.<a name="FNanchor_8_65" id="FNanchor_8_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_65" class="fnanchor">(8)</a> When a young man or a virgin dies, [they
put on] silk and velvet clothes, and gold rings on the ears
and fingers, and so they bury young people who have not
been married. And when one marries a young woman who
should be a virgin, and [he] finds that she is not a virgin,
he sends her back to her father, and will not take her unless
more fortune is given to her, than was arranged at the contract.
They have only one cross in their churches, and not
more, and say, it is a sin to crucify our Lord more than
once in a church. They have no paintings on their altars,
and their patriarchs and bishops grant no indulgence in
their churches, and say, that pardon and remission belong
to the living God, and if a man goes into the church with
repentance and devotion, God, in his compassion, will grant
him pardon and remission of his sins. When the priest
finishes the Mass, he does not give the blessing; he descends
from the altar, and men and women go up to him,
and he touches one after the other on the head, and says:
“Asswatz thogu thu miechk”; which means: God forgive
thee thy sins.<a name="FNanchor_9_65" id="FNanchor_9_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_65" class="fnanchor">(9)</a> They read low Mass aloud, that everybody
may hear, and they pray for those who are entrusted
to them, and for everything for which they ought to pray;
for the ecclesiastical and lay authorities over all Christendom,
and they pray for the Roman emperor, and all kings, dukes,
barons, counts, and knights, who are subject to him;<a name="FNanchor_10_65" id="FNanchor_10_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_65" class="fnanchor">(10)</a> and
while he thus prays, all the people kneel, and raise their
hands to God, and say: “Ogornicka”; which means: Lord
have mercy upon us. And whilst the priest prays, these words
are continually repeated by the women and men. They behave
with much devotion in their churches; they do not look
here and there, and do not speak, especially while they are
at Mass. They decorate their churches beautifully, and
have fine vestments of velvet and of silk of all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
colours. None of their laity dare to read the gospel as our
own learned laity do, who, when they come across a book,
read what they find in it; no one dares to do so, for, should he
read the gospel, he would be under the ban of the patriarch,
because they say that no one is to read the gospel but a
priest. They incense their houses every Saturday, and on
the eve of every feast-day, and no one has any other incense
than the white incense which grows in Arabia and in
India. Priests and laymen eat like the Infidels, sitting on
the ground. They have not many preachers amongst their
priests, because everyone is not allowed to preach. Their
preacher must be well read in the Holy Scriptures, and
must have power from the patriarch to preach, and when
he has the power, he may punish a bishop. Such a preacher
they call Varthabiet, which is the same as being a legate;
and there are more than one, and they move from one
city to the other and preach. When a priest or bishop does
wrong, they punish him for it, and say, that if a priest
teaches the Word of God, but does not understand and
attend to it, he commits a sin.<a name="FNanchor_11_65" id="FNanchor_11_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_65" class="fnanchor">(11)</a></p>

<h2>66.—Why the Greeks and Armeni are enemies.</h2>

<p>The Greeks and Armeni are always enemies, and I will tell
you why it is so, because I have heard it from the Armenians.
The Tartars came into Greece with forty thousand men, and
did much harm to the country, and then lay siege to Constantinoppel.
Then the emperor of Constantinoppel sent
to the king of Armenia for forty knights, the best he had in
the land, and asked him to help him. The king asked how
many there were [of the enemy]; the ambassador replied to
him, that there were forty thousand. Then the king of
Armenia selected forty knights, the best he had in his land:
“I will send forty knights to the emperor, who will, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
God’s help, exterminate the Infidels, and drive them by
force out of the country.” When the knights came near
Constantinoppel to the emperor, then the ambassador told
him what he was ordered to say. The emperor thought
that the king of Armenia wanted to make fun of him; and
on the third day, the knights went before the emperor, and
asked to be allowed to go at the enemy. The emperor
asked them if they meant to overcome forty thousand men?
They asked to be allowed to go out, and that the gate
should be shut after them, for they should have Almighty
God on their side, and would fight with Him for the Christian
faith, to do which they had come, or else they would
die. He gave them leave, and they went out amongst the
enemy, and killed eleven hundred of them, besides the
prisoners they brought to the gate; but the emperor would
not let them come in, unless they also killed the prisoners,
so they killed them all in front of the gate. The emperor
was frightened at this, and took great care of them, and
treated them very well, and they fought with the enemy
every day, and every day did them much harm in the fight,
and in a short time expelled the enemy from the city, and
drove them out of the country. And when the devoted
knights had driven away the Tartars, they went to the
emperor, and wanted leave to return to their king; but the
emperor took council how he was to put them to death, and
invited them to stay with him three days longer; he would
shew them great honour and consideration, and called out
aloud: “Whoever wishes to eat and drink and live well
at the emperor’s court for three days, let him come.” He
sent a pure virgin to each knight at his separate lodging,
and this he did that the virgins might be got with child
by the knights, and that they should leave their seed
there; because the emperor told his lords that he wanted
to take the fruit from the trees and fell the trees, thinking,
that after he had killed the knights, the king of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>Ermenia
would become subject to him. On the third night,
he ordered that all the knights should be killed in their
lodgings, which was done, with the exception of one who
had been warned by the young woman he had with him.
He returned and complained to the king that all his companions
had been killed by [order of] the emperor. The
king was terrified, and grieved much for his devoted
knights, and wrote to the emperor that he had sent to him
forty men who were worth forty thousand; and he must
know that I will come to him, and for each of my forty
knights will kill forty thousand men. Then the king of
Ermenia sent to the Kaliphat of Babilony to ask his aid to
march against the Greek emperor. The Kalipha himself
came to help him with a great many people, and then they
advanced together against the emperor with four hundred
thousand men. This the emperor of Constantinoppel heard
of, and went out to meet them with a great many people,
and fought with them, but it was not long before he fled
into the city of Constantinoppel. They followed him as far
as the sea opposite to Constantinopoli, and encamped there.
Then the king asked the Calypha to give him all the men
he had made prisoners, and he would give him all the booty
he had taken from the Greek. This was done. The king
took the prisoners opposite to the city, and killed forty-times
forty thousand men; and he made the arm of the sea
red with blood, because he had sworn that he would give to
the sea the colour of blood; and after all this was done, he
still had so many prisoners, that thirty Greeks were given
for an onion; this was done to insult the emperor, that it
might be said that thirty Greeks were given for an onion.<a name="FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_66" class="fnanchor">(1)</a>
The Armenians are a brave people, those that live amongst
the Christians, [as well as] those that live amongst the
Infidels. They are also clever at work, because all the clever
work the Infidels can do, in gold, purple, silver, and velvet,
the Armenians can also do, and they also make good scarlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
I have described and named the countries, cities, and religions,
that I have been in amongst the Infidels. I have
also written about the fights in which I have been, and
of the religion of the Infidels of which I have experience,
and with many other marvels which are already touched
upon. Now you will hear and understand how and through
which countries I have come away.</p>

<h2>67.—Through which countries I have come
away.</h2>

<p>When Zegra was defeated, as is already related, I came
over to a lord named Manstzusch; he had been a councillor
of Zegra. He was obliged to fly, and he went to a city called
Kaffa, where there are Christians; it is a strong city in which
there are [people of] six kinds of religion. There he remained
five months, and then crossed an arm of the Black Sea, and
came to a country called Zerckchas; there he remained half a
year. When the Tartar king became aware of this, he sent
to the lord of the country, and asked that he should not
allow the lord Mantzuch to remain in his territory, and he
would do him a great favour. Mantzuch went into another
country called Magrill; and, as we now came into the country
of Magrill, we, five Christians, agreed, that we should go to
our native country from the land of the Infidels, as we were
not more than three days’ journey from the Black Sea; and
when it appeared to us opportune and right to get away,
all five of us escaped from the said lord, and came to the
chief town of the country, which was called Bothan, on the
Black Sea shore, and begged that we should be taken
across [the sea], but it was not granted to us. Then we
left the city, and rode along the sea-shore, and got to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
mountainous country. There we rode until the fourth day,
and came to a mountain from which we saw a kocken on
the sea, at about eight Italian miles from the coast. We
remained on the mountain until night, and made a fire, and
when the captain saw the fire, he sent some men in a skiff
that they might see who we were near the fire on the mountain,
and when they came towards us, we made ourselves
known. They asked what sort of people we were? We said
we were Christians, and were made prisoners when the king
of Ungern was defeated at Nicopolis, and had come so far
with the help of God; therefore, might we not go over the
sea, as we had dependance and hope in God, that we should
yet return to our homes and to Christianity. They would not
believe us, and asked if we could repeat the Pater Noster,
the Ave Maria, and the Belief? We said, “Yes”, and repeated
them. They then asked how many of us there were?
We said, “Five”. They told us to wait on the mountain,
and went to their master and told him how we had spoken to
them. He ordered that we should be brought, and they came
with the skiff, and took us to the kocken. On the third day
that we were on board the kocken, pirates came in three
galleys, and would gladly have done us harm, because they
were Turks. They chased us three days and two nights,
but could do us no harm. We got to the city of Sant
Masicia;<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">(1)</a> there we remained until the fourth day, then
the Turks went their own way. After that, we went to sea.
We wanted to go to Constantinoppoli; but when we got out
to sea, so that we could see nothing but sky and water, there
came a wind which threw back the kocken about eight hundred
Italian miles, to a city called Synopp. There we remained
eight days, and after that we went further, and were
one month and a half on the sea without being able to get
to the land; and we ran short of food, and we had no more
to eat and drink, until we got to a rock in the sea, where we
found snails and crabs, which we picked off, and upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>which we lived for four days, and were one month on the
sea before we got to Constantinoppoli. And when we
got there, I and my companions remained, and the kock
passed through the strait for Italy. And as we were
passing through the gate into Constantinopel, they asked
us where we came from? We replied, that we had been
prisoners amongst the Infidels, and that we had escaped,
and wanted to return to Christianity. Then they took
us before the Greek emperor, who asked us how we
had escaped from the Infidels? We related to him from
the beginning to the end, and when he heard it all, he
told us not to be anxious; he would take care to send
us home; and he sent us to the patriarch, who also lives in
the city, and ordered us to wait until he sent a galley for
his brother, who was with the queen of Unger, when he
would help us into Walachy. Thus we were three months
at Constantinoppel, which is surrounded by a wall eighteen
Italian miles [in extent], and the wall has fifteen hundred
towers. There are one thousand and one churches in the
city, and the principal church is called Sant Sophia, which
is built, and is also paved, with polished marble, so that
when one who has not been before, goes into the temple, he
imagines that the church is full of water, the marble shines
so. It has a large dome covered with lead. It has three
hundred and sixty gates, of which one hundred are quite of
brass.<a name="FNanchor_2_67" id="FNanchor_2_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_67" class="fnanchor">(2)</a> After three months, the Greek emperor sent us
in a galley to a fortress called Gily, where the Tunow flows
into the Black Sea. At this fortress I separated from my
companions and joined some merchants, and went with
them to a city called in German the White City, situated
in Walachy. Then I came to a city called Asparseri;<a name="FNanchor_3_67" id="FNanchor_3_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_67" class="fnanchor">(3)</a>
then to a city called Sedschoff, the capital of Little Walachy;
then to a place called in German, Limburgch, the chief city
in White Reissen the Lesser.<a name="FNanchor_4_67" id="FNanchor_4_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_67" class="fnanchor">(4)</a> There I lay ill for three
months. After that, I came to Krackow, the capital of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>Polan. After that, to Neichsen in Saxony, and to the city
of Bressla, which capital is in Slesy. I then came to a city
called Eger; from Eger to Regenspurg; from Regenspurg
to Lantzhut; from Lantzhut to Frisingen, near which place
I was born; and, with God’s help, I returned to my home
and to Christianity. Almighty God be thanked, and all
those who have helped me. And when I had almost despaired
of coming [away] from the Infidel people and their
wicked religion, amongst whom I was obliged to be for
<span class="smcap">XXXII</span> years, and of any longer having fellowship with holy
Christianity, God Almighty saw my great longing and
anxiety after the Christian faith and its heavenly joys, and
graciously preserved me from the risk of perdition of body
and soul; therefore, I ask all who have read or have heard
this book read, that they should think kindly of me before
God, so that they should be eternally freed, there and here,
from such heavy and unchristian captivity. Amen.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">(1.)</a> “Then came many people from all countries to help him.“—The
army of King Sigismund, made up of contingents from
various states, consisted of about 100,000 men at the siege
of Nicopolis, 60,000 being horsemen. An Eastern writer has estimated
the number of fighting men at 130,000 (Aschbach, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch.
K. Sigmunds</cite>, i, 101, Saad-eddin, <cite>Bratutti edition</cite>). In his narrative
of the action, Bonfinius (<cite>Rer. Hung. Decad. III.</cite>, ii, 403) repeats
the proud boast of the king of Hungary, that not only should he
turn the Turks out of Europe, but were the sky itself to fall, he
was prepared to support it on the points of his lances.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_1" id="Footnote_2_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_1">(2.)</a> “Pudem.”—In the middle ages, this city was called Bdin or
Bydinum (Schafarik, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Slawische Alterthümer</cite>, etc., ii, 217), transformed
by Schiltberger into Pudem, and by Marshal de Boucicault (Petitot
<cite>Collect.</cite>, vi, 448) into Baudins. According to Mannert, quoted by
Hammer (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de l’E. O.</cite>, i, 416), Widdin was situated on the
site of the ancient Bononia, now called by the people Bodon; but
he makes no mention of the Βιδύνη of the Byzantines, which he
would have found on consulting Acropolita. Widdin, the capital
of Western Bulgaria, was inherited by J. Sracimir upon the death
of his father, the King John Alexander, in 1365; and Eastern Bulgaria
was bestowed by this sovereign on his younger son, Shishman
III. The former was under the necessity of acknowledging
the suzerainty of the Porte, in the reign of Amurat I; and there
is every reason for supposing that it was he whom Boucicault
(448) designates the lord of the country, in saying, that he was a
Greek Christian, forcibly subjected to the Turks.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_1" id="Footnote_3_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_1">(3.)</a> “The king took possession of this city also.”—Hammer
(328) and Engel (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. U. R.</cite>, ii, 198) are of opinion, that
Schiltberger here refers to the city of Orsova; but the former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>allows, that the city believed by Engel to be Orsova, was the Aristum
of Bonfinius (<cite>Rer. Hung. Decad. III.</cite>, ii, 377), called Raco by the
French Marshal (449); it may therefore be conceded that the
city in question was Rahova, on the road taken by the Christian
army, which would have been retracing its steps, had its aim, after
the capture of Widdin, been the siege of Orsova.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(3<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) “Nicopoly.”—In my <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geographische Anmerkungen zum
Reisebuch von Schiltberger (Sitzungsberichte d. Kön. Bay. Akad.</cite>,
1869, ii, 271), I have endeavoured to shew that, in stating that the
Infidels knew the city of “Schiltaw” by the name of “Nicopoly”,
Schiltberger does not call attention to the city of Nicopolis on the
Danube, near the estuary of the Osma, but to ancient Nicopolis
founded by Trajan, the ruins of which are still to be seen near the
village of Nikup, on the Rushita, a tributary of the Yantra. I
was formerly of opinion that the battle which decided the Eastern
question at that period, was fought near the village, and this
opinion, adopted by several authors of merit, has recently been
supported by M. Jirecek in his admirable work, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte der
Bulgaren</cite>, wherein reference is made to an ancient Servian Chronicle
in which it is recorded, that the battle took place “na rece Rositê
u Nikopolju”. It would appear, however, that the author of this
notice, through some misapprehension, confounded the Rushita
with the Osma; and M. Kanitz (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Donau-Bulgarien</cite>, ii, 58–70) having
lately, on just grounds, condemned my hypothesis, I am now persuaded
that the Christians were defeated by Bajazet in the neighbourhood
of the present town of Nicopolis, which was in existence
at that time, though from what period is not known; nor are we
able to determine when the ancient Nicopolis “ad Hæmum”, disappeared.</p>

<p>If Schiltberger’s contemporaries sometimes designated the one
city by the name of Great Nicopolis, they did so simply to distinguish
it from a fortress on the opposite, the left bank of the
Danube, called Little Nicopolis, that was taken by the Christians
in the preceding campaign (Jirecek, 354). It is, therefore, just
possible, that the sultan, having passed Trnov, or Ternova, when
on his way to the besieged city, had also entered Tchunkatch (see
trans. of the Turkish historiographer, Neshry, in <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschr. d. D.
Morgenl. Gesellsch.</cite>, xv, 346), the name possibly given by Neshry to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>the castle of Tchuka, the ruins of which are to be seen in the upper
part of the city, called now as it was then, Shvishtov, Shistov,
Sistova, situated at a distance of fifteen miles to the south-east of
the field of battle. If such were indeed the case, I would venture
to suggest, until some better explanation is offered, that our author
may, by mistake or through some misconception, have given to
the besieged city the name of Shistov, corrupted by him to
“Schiltaw”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(3<span class="smcap lowercase">B.</span>) Nicopolis, the city besieged “by water and by land for <span class="smcap">XVI</span>
days”, must, unquestionably, have been the place of that name on
the right bank of the Danube, and not ancient Nicopolis, “ad
Istrum”, as believed by some authors, the site of which, distant
nearly forty miles from the river, has been satisfactorily determined
by M. Kanitz, from an inscription he has been fortunate
enough to disinter out of a mass of its ruins. The present Nicopolis,
built on a limestone cliff, fills a ravine formed by two
heights commanding the town. Sigismund may, or may not,
have occupied those heights; but, when surprised at his dinner, at
ten o’clock in the morning on the day of the battle, by being informed
that the Turks were making their appearance (Froissart,
iv, c. 52), he advanced one mile only from his encampment outside
the beleaguered city, for the purpose of encountering Bajazet;
and the French assumed the offensive immediately after the “Duke
of Walachy” had reconnoitred the enemy’s position. If a further
advance was made at all, it could scarcely have covered much
ground, seeing that the 12,000 foot-soldiers routed by Sigismund
had advanced to oppose him; and when the king was about to
follow up his victory by attacking a body of horse, the sultan
being on the point of taking to flight, the timely aid of the latter’s
ally, the despot of Servia, changed the fortunes of the day. The
battle, says Froissart, lasted three hours only, and the result, so
disastrous to the Christian army, he attributes to the impetuosity
of Philippe d’Artois, Comte d’Eu, who disregarded the instructions
of the king of Hungary. “Nous perdons hui la journée”, said the
latter to the Grand Master of Rhodes, “par l’orgueil et bobant
(vanity) de ces François; et s’ils m’eussent cru, nous avions gens
assez pour combattre nos ennemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>The Christian soldiers fled in disorder, and being hard pressed
by Bajazet’s troops, many were killed on the mountain, one of the
heights near Nicopolis, as they hurried to the Danube, many others
being drowned in their unsuccessful efforts to reach the shipping—probably
some of the vessels of the Venetian blockading squadron,
under the command of Giovanni Mocenigo, on board of which,
Sigismund, and Philibert de Noillac, Grand Master of the Order of
St. John of Jerusalem, were received; the latter being conveyed
to Rhodes, whence the ships sailed for Dalmatia to land the king.
It seems pretty clear, from Schiltberger’s narrative, that the battle
of Nicopolis was fought in the immediate vicinity of the city on
the Danube, and therefore at a considerable distance from the
ancient Nicopolis, the city of Trajan. Details of the action will
be found in Aubert de Vertot d’Aubeuff’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire des Chevaliers
Hospitaliers de St. Jean de Jerusalem</cite>, etc., 1726.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that Schiltberger set foot in Shistova, but
the name had doubtlessly become familiar to him, both before and
after his capture, at a time that he was totally unacquainted with
the language of the people amongst whom he had fallen. If the
incidents of his eventful career were indeed dictated from memory,
his statement that the Infidels knew Nicopolis as “Schiltaw”, for
Shvishtov, Shishtovo, may be accounted for, by the accidental
confusion of names.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_1" id="Footnote_4_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_1">(4.)</a> “Werterwaywod.”—Schiltberger evidently alludes here
to John Mirca (John Mirtcha), prince or voyevoda of Walachia,
called John, by Mme. de Lusson (Engel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. U. R.</cite>, iv, 160:
iii, 5), and Marcus, by the Byzantines (L. Chalco, 77). He was
the son of the voyevoda, J. Radul, and having succeeded his
elder brother, J. Dan, added the Dobroudja to his domains after
the short reign of Ivanko or Iuanchus, “filius bonæ memoriæ magnifici
domini Dobrdize”, as he is styled in the treaty concluded
with the Genoese in 1387 (<cite>Not. et Extr.</cite>, etc., xi, 65; and <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mem.
de l’Inst. de France</cite>, vii, 292–334). There is no difficulty in recognising
the Bulgarian despot, Dobrotitch, in the person of the
father, who, after the death of Alexander, declared his independance
in the Dobroudja, whence, in all probability, its name.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>(Bruun, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journ. du Minis. de l’Instruc. Pub.</cite>, St. Petersburg, Sept.
1877.)—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_1" id="Footnote_5_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_1">(5.)</a> “he had come a great distance with six thousand men.”—The
force commanded by the Comte de Nevers, son of Philip,
Duke of Burgundy, consisted of 1000 knights, 1000 soldiers, and
6000 mercenaries. The Count was supported by the flower of the
French nobility. Aschbach (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. K. Sigmund’s</cite>, i, 98) places
the total at 10,000 men.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_1" id="Footnote_6_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_1">(6.)</a> “Duke of Iriseh, known as the despot.”—Stephen, prince
of Servia, is here designated the despot of “Iriseh”, because Servia
at that time was also known as Rascia. Thus—“ipsum regnum
Rasciæ—regno Hungariæ; ab antiquo subjectum”, etc. (Engel,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. U. R.</cite>, iii, 370). Windeck, the contemporary biographer
of Sigismund (Aschbach, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. K. Sigmund’s</cite>, i, 234), likewise
states, that the king advanced “gegen Sirfien und Raizen,
und bedingte mit dem Tischbot”, that is to say, the despot. As
the Turks are in the habit of preceding with an I, all foreign
names commencing with a consonant, so may Schiltberger’s comrades,
as Magyars, have converted Rascia into Iriseh.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_7_1" id="Footnote_7_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_1">(7.)</a> “Duke of Burgony.”—This Duke of Burgundy was the
valiant Comte de Nevers, aged 22 years only, afterwards surnamed
Jean sans Peur; he was uncle to Charles VI. “Hanns Putzokardo”
is easily recognised as the John Boucicault already noticed.
As to the lord “Centumaranto”, Fallmerayer believes
this person to have been Saint Omer, without, however, stating
any reason for this belief; it is, therefore, more probable that
Châteaumorant should be substituted for the name given by
Schiltberger.</p>

<p>We read in Boucicault, that one Jean Chasteaumorant arrived
in Turkey, with the money for the ransom of the French knights.
It is very possible that a namesake, and even a near relative of
this Châteaumorant, was among them, to whom the marshal afterwards
entrusted the defence of Constantinople against the Turks,
upon his own return to France.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2">(1.)</a> “Hannsen of Bodem. “The Marshal Boucicault (Petitot
<i>Collect.</i>, 465, 471) confirms Schiltberger’s statement, to the effect
that Bajazet consented to spare the lives of a certain number of
great lords, hoping “to receive from them much treasure and gold”.
Henri and Philippe de Bar, cousins-german of the king, the Constable
Count d’Eu, the Count de la Marche, and the Lord de la
Trémouille, were of the number. No clue is given to the correct
name and nationality of Stephen Synüher, but as he and the lord
of Bodem (Widdin) are distinguished from the twelve French
nobles whose lives were spared, it is pretty certain that allusion is
made to Stephen Simontornya, nephew to Stephen Laszkovitz, voyevoda
of Transylvania (Hurmuzaki, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Fragm. zur Gesch. der Rum.</cite>, 225).
Aschbach informs us, that the uncle and nephew, who had both
assisted at the battle of Nicopolis, were the first to take to flight;
but it is very possible, that the nephew happened to be among
those who failed to reach the river in time to enable him to
embark, and was thus made a prisoner. John of Bodem was undoubtedly
John Sracimir, king of Western Bulgaria, whose capital
was Widdin.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">(2.)</a> “Kalipoli.”—Gallipoli, is mentioned (Ducas., <cite>Hist. Byz.</cite>)
as being the first town occupied by the Turks (1356) on
the European continent. By the treaty of Adrianople, 1204,
upon the fall of the Empire, Gallipoli, which had been strongly
fortified by the Byzantine emperors, fell to the Venetians; but
the possession of an important stronghold commanding the entrance
to the Marmora and Black Sea, was continually disputed
by the Italians and Greeks, until the year 1307, when the Genoese
and Greeks having, as allies, vanquished the Catalans in the Sea
of Marmora, laid siege to Gallipoli, to which place those mercenaries
of the Empire had been sent, who, after destroying the
town and devastating the country around, withdrew into Attica
and Bœotia. The Turks rebuilt the fortifications, which were
greatly strengthened by Bajazet, who also constructed a port for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>his galleys. The Count de Nevers and 24 of his illustrious companions
in arms, were detained in captivity at Gallipoli, and afterwards
at Broussa, until ransomed for the sum of 200,000 golden
ducats. (Heyd., <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Colonie Commer.</cite>, i, 347; Hammer, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de
l’E. O.</cite>, i, 106.)—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_2" id="Footnote_3_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_2">(3.)</a> “Windischy land.”—According to Froissart (iv, c. 52),
Sigismund embarked at Constantinople on board of a vessel that
had just discharged a cargo of provisions. It is stated in the
<cite>History of Cyprus</cite>, that the king arrived in Dalmatia by way of
Rhodes. Thwrocz (Schwandtnerus, <cite>Script. Rerum Hung.</cite>, iv, 9)
adds, that he afterwards landed in Croatia, the country alluded
to by Schiltberger as “Windischy land”. See “Windische Mark”,
in <cite>Cosmographey</cite>.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_3" id="Footnote_1_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_3">(1.)</a> “and the people he took away, and some he left in Greece.”—Baron
Hammer points out, that Styrian historians have not
noticed this fact, with which, in all probability, is connected the
origin of certain Slave settlements in Asia Minor. M. Lamansky
(<cite>O Slav. v. Mal. Asii</cite>) however, believes, they are of more ancient
date.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_3" id="Footnote_2_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_3">(2.)</a> “king-sultan.”—Schiltberger styles the sultan of Egypt,
king-sultan, because, having the caliph at his court, he was considered
as being at the head of all Mahomedan monarchs. The
sultan at the period indicated was Barkok, the first of the dynasty
of Circassian Mamelouks, if we except Bibars II, whose
reign, 1309–1310, was of the shortest duration. Twenty years
before his accession (1382), Barkok was carried as a slave into

country in the Caucasus.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">(3.)</a> “king of Babylony.”—This king of Babylon was Ahmed,
son of Oveis, son of the Jelarid Hassan the Great, the descendant
of Abaka, the son of Houlakou, the son of Tuly, son of Jengiz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>Khan. Timour drove Ahmed from Baghdad, but he returned upon
several occasions, notably in 1395, and remained until 1402.
Previously to the battle of Nicopolis, Bajazet had written to tell
him that, in his opinion, the expulsion of Timour was of greater
moment than that of the Takfour, that is to say, of the Greek
emperor (Hammer, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de l’E. O.</cite>, ii, 466, note xv).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_3" id="Footnote_4_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_3">(4.)</a> “king of Persia.”—Even before the battle of Nicopolis,
nearly the whole of Persia had been subjugated by Timour, and
divided between his sons, Omar Sheykh and Miran Shah, and
other amirs. The Shah Mansour, who had also appealed to Bajazet
for succour, perished in 1393 at the battle of Sheeraz; the
other princes of the house of Mouzzafer had been put to death,
with the exception of Zein Alabin, and Shebel, the two sons of
the shah Shoudia, who ended their days at Samarkand (Weil.,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>, ii, 40); it is, consequently, somewhat puzzling
to determine, to which sovereign of Persia the Christian captives
were sent.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_3" id="Footnote_5_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_3">(5.)</a> “White Tartary.”—According to Neumann, Schiltberger
here seeks to distinguish the free Tatars from the Black Tatars, that
is to say, the vanquished and paying tribute. Erdmann (<cite>Temud.
d. U.</cite>, 194), on the authority of Rashid uddin, considers that by
White Tatars were meant the Turk tribes, who were afterwards
known as Mongols, the Black Tatars being the real Mongols. He tells
us, that after having subdued the White Tatars and other Turk
people, the Black resumed their ancient name of Mongols, and
extended their sway to Eastern Europe, including under the
name of Tatars even the Turks in the West, with the exception
of those by whom they were opposed in Asia Minor, and who
afterwards became known in Europe as the Ottoman Turks.</p>

<p>This, however, does not explain to us where the White Tatars,
repeatedly mentioned by Schiltberger, dwelt. We learn from
him, first, that a powerful lord from their country was the son-in-law
of Kady Bourhan uddin, sovereign of Sebaste, who was put
to death by Kara Yelek or Oulouk, chief of the Turkomans of the
White Sheep: secondly; that, having laid siege to the city of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>Angora, which belonged to Bajazet, they were forced to yield to
him; and, thirdly, that at the battle of Angora, 30,000 of them
went over to Timour, and were the cause of his gaining the day.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration these several facts, is it not possible,
that the White Tatars of Schiltberger are to be identified with
those of the White Horde of Eastern writers; the Blue, as
they were sometimes alluded to by Russian annalists, perhaps because
of their encampments on the shores of the Blue Sea, the
Lake Aral? This Horde, as the patrimony of the elder branch of
the house of Jujy, whose chief town was Ssaganak, near the upper
Syr Darya, was dependent to a certain extent on the Golden Horde,
ruled over by the descendants of Batou, the second son of Jujy.
But this state of dependence was not of long duration, for towards
the close of the 14th century, the famous Toktamish, a prince
of the elder branch, succeeded in annexing the whole of the Golden
Horde to his possessions, after having, with the assistance of
Timour, rid himself of his uncle Ourous Khan. Having quarrelled
with his protector, this ambitious man was under the necessity of
courting the friendship of Bajazet, who was only too pleased to
secure another ally against the threatening domination of the ruler
of Jagatai; there is, therefore, nothing surprising in the fact of
the sultan sending a certain number of Christian captives to
Toktamish, were it only to console him for the unfortunate termination
to his war with Timour in 1395. At all events, the
partisans of Toktamish, who effected their escape under the
leadership of Timour Tash, upon the defeat of the former near the
banks of the Terek, were received by the sultan with open arms.
Savelieff (<cite>Mon. Joud.</cite>, 314) gives it as his opinion, that Timour Tash
who held the Crimea under the suzerainty of Toktamish, was
himself a member of the Jujy family; in which case the sovereign
of Sebaste might well have given his daughter in marriage
to him, without contracting a misalliance, and the very nature of
this alliance, may have incited Timour Tash to treat his benefactor
with ingratitude in laying siege to Sebaste, his whole household
being in his suite, after the custom of the country. Having
necessarily become reconciled with the sultan, he might easily
have treated him with treachery at the battle of Angora, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>passing over to the ranks of his countrymen; in such a case they
would have obtained a victory, in consequence of defection
amongst the Tatars in the service of Bajazet, as we are informed
by Arabian authors, and not, as Persian and Turkish historians
have imagined, through defection among “the Turk princes of
Asia Minor”.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, no easy matter to reconcile this hypothesis
with the statement made by Clavijo (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>, 75). After
alluding to the capture of Sebaste by Timour, the Spanish envoy
continues:—“Before he arrived there, he met with a race called
the White Tartars, who always wander over the plain; and he
fought and conquered them, and took their lord prisoner; and
took away as many as fifty thousand men and women with him.
He then marched to Damascus,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>In another passage, he returns to the Tartaros Blancos subdued
by Tamerlane, and says that they were encamped between Turkey
(Asia Minor) and Syria. These White Tatars were evidently
identical with the White Tatars of Schiltberger, who had nothing
in common with the Tatars of the White Horde, frequently designated
as being of “Great Tartary”. It may therefore be assumed
that the White Tatars mentioned by both travellers, were Turkomans,
inhabitants of the eastern parts of Asia Minor, whose descendants
have to this day preserved the Mongol type, and the
same mode of living as the White Tatars of Schiltberger and
Clavijo (Viv. de Saint-Martin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desc. de l’A. M.</cite>, ii, 429). East
Cilicia was at that time actually divided between two Turkoman
dynasties, which had not been vanquished by the Ottoman arms;
small states that had existed from the year 1378, the date at
which the Lusignans, who had succeeded the Roupenian dynasty
of Little Armenia in 1342, were expelled from Cilicia by the
Baharite Mamelouks of Egypt. The one reigned at Marash, the
other at Adana; the latter being known as the Ben Ramazan, the
former as the Soulkadyr or Joulkadyr, the name by which Marash
was afterwards known amongst Turkish geographers. Both
dynasties were in existence until 1515, when they were subjugated
by the sultan, Selim, and their territories incorporated with the
empire (Viv. de Saint-Martin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desc. de l’A. M.</cite>, i, 529).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>It would appear that the rulers of the White Tatars, alluded to
by Clavijo, belonged to the family of the Joulkadyr. It was, at
any rate, against that dynasty, Timour despatched a force after the
capture of Sivas, to punish it for its hostility towards himself,
when besieging that city (Weil., <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>, v, 82); and
the Mongols soon afterwards carried off all the herds belonging to
a prince of this house, whose encampment was near Palmyra
(<i>ibid.</i>, 91). As was the case with the White Tatars of Clavijo,
those mentioned by Schiltberger drew their rulers, at least in
part, from princes of this house. It was Bajazet’s desire, that his
son should marry the daughter of Nazr uddin Joulkadyr, who
would not have been forgotten at the distribution of prisoners taken
at Nicopolis. This Nazr uddin had received his fugitive relative,
the son of Bourhan uddin, the brother-in-law, according to Schiltberger,
of the ruler of the White Tatars. It appears to me that
the seeming diversity in the statements made by various authors,
with regard to the nationality of the troops who went over to
Timour at the battle of Angora, is to be explained by admitting,
that the Tatars who betrayed the cause of Bajazet, were Turkomans
who acknowledged the authority of the Ben Ramazan and
the Joulkadyr; that is to say, that their rulers were princes
holding possessions in Asia Minor. Our author’s recital enables
us to understand, why Oriental writers would seem to be at
issue as to the nationality of the “Tatar Regiments” (Weil.,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. I. V.</cite>, 437) which deserted their colours at the battle
of Angora.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

Greater, to distinguish it from the Lesser, which was understood
to be the eastern part of Cappadocia, near the Euphrates. In the
middle ages, the denomination Lesser Armenia included the whole
of Cappadocia, inasmuch as it was inhabited by Armenians who
had been expelled from their own country by the Seljouks and Turkomans
(11th and 12th centuries). At a subsequent period, the
Armenians occupied nearly the whole of Cilicia and the west of
Syria, anciently called Commagen, and afterwards known as
Euphrates. All these new acquisitions were included under the
name of Lesser Armenia.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4">(1.)</a> “Karanda.”—This city, on the site of ancient Laranda,
is now known as Karaman, so named after the son of a certain
Sophy, upon whom it was bestowed (1219–46) by Ala uddin,
sultan of Iconium, together with a portion of Cappadocia and of
Cilicia, that is to say, of Lesser Armenia. Mohammed, the son
of Karaman, extended the limits of his states in every direction,
and even took possession of Iconium or Konieh. His son Ali
Bek, surnamed Ala uddin, was married to Nefise, the sister of
Bajazet, an alliance, however, that did not restrain him from invading
Ottoman territory, an act which resulted in war between
the brothers-in-law, and he was made a prisoner by the Turks
after the fall of Iconium, in 1392. According to Saad uddin
(Zinkeisen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. O. R.</cite>, i, 350), Karaman was killed by
Timour Tash, governor of Angora, without the knowledge of
Bajazet, who would have spared his brother-in-law. Ahmed and
Mohammed, the sons of Karaman, were afterwards reinstated
by Timour in their possessions, which included, besides Laranda,
evidently the “Karanda” in the text, the cities of Alaïa,
Derendeh, Sis, Veysheher, Konieh, Aksheher, Akseraï, and
Anazarba.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_5">(1.)</a> “Sebast.”—Sebaste, called Sivas by the Turks, and Sepasdia,
Sevasdia, Sevasd, by the Armenians—the capital of Lesser
Armenia, after being long subject to Constantinople, was ceded, in
1021, by the emperor Basil to Senckharim, king of Armenia, in
exchange for Vasbouragan. It was taken in 1080 by the
Greeks, who lost it to the Seljouks (J. Saint Martin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mem. sur
l’Arménie</cite>, i, 187).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_6" id="Footnote_1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_6">(1.)</a> “Wirmirsiana.”—According to Chalcocondylas, Orthobulus
or Ertoghrul, the eldest son of Bajazet, was made a captive by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>Timour at Sebaste, in 1400, and shortly afterwards put to death;
but no Arabian or Persian chroniclers have asserted this, nor
does Shereef uddin allude to the circumstance. Arabshah
(Weil., <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>, ii, 82) says that Souleiman, the son of
Bajazet, was governor of Sebaste, which he must have quitted
before its conquest by the Mongols.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_7" id="Footnote_1_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_7">(1.)</a> “city of Samson.”—This is the ancient Amisos, still called
Samsoun by the Turks. Fallmerayer (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. K. v. T.</cite>, 56, 289)
observes, that the Byzantines frequently added a prefix to a name,
such as εἰς, which, in time, became contracted to ες and σ, and in
this way Ἄμισον was turned into σ' Ἄμισον—Σάμσον. This city,
the chief town of Janyk, was then under the dominion of another
Bajazet, surnamed the Impotent, who perished in his struggle
with Bajazet about 1392.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Fallmerayer’s explanation may be further illustrated, by
quoting the names of ancient cities in the Morea and in the island
of Crete, that have undergone change through the probable corruptions
of a prefix. Hierapytna has become Tzerapetra; Itanus
is now Tzetana, Tsitana, and even Sitana. Etea has become Setea,
while Stamboul, Istamboul, itself is a corruption of Εἰς τὴν πόλιν.
The modern Greeks would also appear to be in the habit of thus
corrupting words in ordinary use, as, for instance, ampelon, vineyard,
they call tsembela; kampos, a field, tzecampo, etc. (Spratt,
<cite>Researches in Crete</cite>, i, 55, 200).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_8" id="Footnote_1_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_8">(1.)</a> “Italians of Genoa.”—It is not known when the Genoese
founded a colony at Samsoun, which they called Simisso. Heyd
(<cite>d. Ital. Handelscolon</cite>, etc., in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift f. d. gesam. Staatswissenschaft</cite>.,
xviii, 710) justly observes, that they must have been
there previously to the year 1317, because the existence of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>Genoese consul at Simisso at that date, is proved by the records of
Gazaria. In the Regulations for Gazaria, 1449 (<cite>Zap. Odess.</cite>, v, p.
629), no mention whatever is made of a consul being at Simisso;
I cannot therefore agree with M. Heyd that the consulate was
maintained until 1461, when Mahomet II drove the Genoese out
of Samastris (Amastris), their principal port, and took possession
of Sinope, where, to the year 1449, those Italians still had a consul
(<i>ibid.</i>, 809). The Genoese were driven out of Samsoun, in all
probability in 1419, when that quarter of the town “occupied by
infidels” was taken by Mahomet I (Hammer, ii, 180, 472, note
xiv). At this period Schiltberger was still in Asia, and he appears
to have been aware that the Genoese were obliged to quit the
town. At any rate, in saying that the Italians of Genoa were
still in possession of it, in the reign of Bajazet, he probably
wished to intimate that they had quitted it at a later
period.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_8" id="Footnote_2_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_8">(2.)</a> “Ternowa.”—Trnovo or Ternov, the capital of Eastern
Bulgaria, was taken and destroyed by the Turks in 1393, at a
moment that Shishman happened to be absent. Turkish authors
have recorded, that at Nicopolis he surrendered at discretion, and
died, according to some, in confinement, and at an advanced age;
others, however, state that he was beheaded, which, judging by
the narrative in the text, would appear doubtful. Alexander,
Shishman’s eldest son, having turned Mahomedan, was appointed
governor of Saroukhan, as we are informed by Rehm (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d.
Mittelalt.</cite>, iv, 2, 584); and it is possible that he was transferred
to Samsoun after the conquest of the province of Janyk, in the
province-general of Trebizond. His younger brother Fruzin remained
a Christian, and died at Kronstadt in 1460.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_9" id="Footnote_1_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_9">(1.)</a> “Wurchanadin.”—It has already been noticed that Bourhan
uddin was prince of Sebaste or Sivas. The Turkish lord
named Otman in this chapter, was Kara Yelek, chief of the Turkoman
Horde of the White Sheep.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_9" id="Footnote_2_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_9">(2.)</a> The death of Bourhan uddin.—Oriental writers are at issue
as to the date of the death of Bourhan uddin, and of the incorporation
of his domains with those of Bajazet. Saad uddin
(Weil., <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>, ii, 60, note i) observes, that various
dates are given, from the year 794 to 799 of the Hegira = 1391–96.
In his History of the Ottoman Empire (i, 226), Hammer
expresses himself in favour of the opinion of Nishandi, an Arabian
author, who fixes the date at 795 = 1392. This opinion is supported
by Zinkeisen (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. O. R.</cite>, i, 353), who states he has no
doubt that “the course of events and the most reliable authorities
testify in favour of the year 1392”, although Weil makes it
clear, that the death of Bourhan uddin could not have taken place
before the year 800 = 1398. German historians are guided by
the statements of Oriental writers, who have apparently confounded
two wars between Bajazet and the sovereign of Sebaste,
the one having taken place before, and the other after the battle
of Nicopolis. Indeed we learn from Schiltberger, that previously
to the war in which he himself was engaged (see <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>),
the younger son of Bajazet had driven Bourhan uddin out
of “Marsüany”, a city which, from being situated on the borders
of Karaman, must have been identical with Marsivan (Viv. de
Saint-Martin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desc. de l’A. M.</cite>, ii, 448) or Merzyfoun, as it was
called by Hadjy Khalpha (<cite>Jihan-Numa</cite>, etc., ii, 407), and was
perhaps the village of Morivazou, the birth-place of St. Stephen of
Sougdaia (<cite>Zap. Odess.</cite>, v, 625). In the introduction to his edition
of 1859, Neumann submits that Amasia is here intended; but he
is in error, because that place had already been taken by
Bajazet, not from Bourhan uddin, but from Bajazet the “Impotent”,
together with Samsoun, Kastamouny, and Osmandjyk
(Hammer, i, 312–315).</p>

<p>Neumann is certainly not justified in supposing that Schiltberger
would have alluded upon two occasions to the campaign
in which he took part—first, in chap. 5, casually; again in chap.
9, wherein we have all the details as they are related by an eye-witness;
for, in reference to this, the second campaign, we are informed
that it was conducted by the eldest son of Bajazet, and
that this son was not Mouhammed; indeed, we are previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>told by Schiltberger, that Mouhammed was appointed by the sultan
to command the forces sent to “Marsüany”, it being the first
expedition of that prince, who was aged 14 in 1392, for he died in
1421, in his 43rd year.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_10" id="Footnote_1_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_10">(1.)</a> “Malathea.”—Malatia, the ancient Melitene, on the
Euphrates, was the station of the xiith Legion. Marcus Aurelius
surnamed it “Fulminatrix”, in consequence of a miracle that was
there operated (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite>, etc., x, 860). Hammer (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.
de l’E. O.</cite>, 345), and Zinkeisen (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. O. R.</cite>, 356), assert, on
the authority of Saad uddin, that the Ottomans took this and
other cities subject to the sultans of Egypt, between the years
798 and 800 of the Mahommedan era. Weil (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>,
70–73), however, does not think that this occupation could
have taken place earlier than 801, founding his opinion on the
authority of Arabian writers, who have recorded Turkish aggression
as having occurred after the advent to the throne, of Faradj,
who succeeded his father in 801 = 1399 (June 20). In support
of this argument, Weil quotes the testimony of one of those writers
who had himself seen the letter, in which was announced to
Itmish, the atabek of the new sultan, the capture of Malatia; but
it is also possible that the great dignitary had received this same
letter in the time of Barkok, by whom he must have been highly
esteemed, for, when on his death-bed, the sultan nominated him
his executor. This view of the case agrees with Schiltberger’s
recital, whilst his observations, towards the end of this chapter,
on the taking of Adalia, will serve to explain the strange passage
that occurs in the Italian translation of the book of Saad uddin.
“Et havendo spedito al Conquisto di Chianchria” (Kiankary the
ancient Gangra) “Timurtas-Bassa” (Bajazet’s general) “però tutto
quel Paese insieme con la Città d’Atena (la qual’ è patria de’ Filosofi)
col suo Distretto pervenne in poter del Rè; il quale prese anco
dalle mani de’ Turcomani la Città di Bechsenia” (Behesna) “e di
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>Mallatie”, etc. “There is clearly a mistake in the text or in the
translation”, says Weil (70), after showing that Hammer and Zinkeisen
are greatly in error in supposing, upon the authority of this
defective passage, that the city of Socrates could have been taken
by the Turks in the course of the same campaign as that in which
Malatia fell into their hands; but there would have been nothing
extraordinary in the fact of their attacking Angora after the fall
of this city, and then Satalia, near the ruins of the ancient Attalia
in Pamphylia, in which Neumann fancies that he recognises the
Adalia of Schiltberger, because it was situated on the sea-shore
opposite to the island of Cyprus. In support of this, the esteemed
editor of the edition of 1859 might have quoted another passage,
from the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Patriarchatus Constantinopolitani</cite> (<cite>Zap. Odess.</cite>, v,
966), wherein we find it asserted, that the city of Satalia, having
been occupied by the Infidels in 1400, the bishop of that city took
his departure for Aenos. Notwithstanding these arguments, it
appears to me that the Adalia of Schiltberger could not have
been Satalia, but rather Adana in Cicilia, for the following
reasons.</p>

<p>This city of Adana, Adena, or Adan, is nearer to the island of
Cyprus than is Satalia, although not actually on the sea-shore, a
situation not attributed to his Adalia by Schiltberger. It belonged
to the sultans of Egypt, which was not the case with Satalia, a
city that from the year 1207 had been subject to the sultans of
Iconium, to the Seljouk principality of Tekke, and to the kingdom
of Cyprus, and was already incorporated in the Ottoman Empire
(Weil, i, 505; Heyd, xviii, 714). Finally, Schiltberger’s
notice that the people about Adalia were exclusively employed in
the rearing of camels, is applicable to Adana rather than to
Satalia; for in those days it was one of the chief centres of commerce
in the East, and was encircled by the superb gardens for
which it is so celebrated in our own times. It may, I think, be
conceded that Saad uddin, or Bratutti his translator, have possibly
confounded Athens with Attalia or Adana, and that this
very city might have been subjugated by Timour Tash, soon
after his reduction of Behesna, Malatia, and other cities in
Cilicia.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_11" id="Footnote_1_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_11">(1.)</a> “Thus Joseph expelled his rival, and became a powerful
king.”—Upon the death of the Sultan Barkok, his son Al-Melyk
Al-Nazr Abou-Saadat Faradj, aged thirteen, ascended the throne.
Schiltberger pronounces one of the names of this monarch after
his own fashion, and calls him Joseph, and elsewhere Jusuphda,
evidently in place of Abou-Saadat. This prince, soon after his
accession, was under the necessity of contending in arms with
Itmish (who has already been noticed), one of his father’s dependants,
as Schiltberger represents Joseph to have done. Faradj
perished, as did Jusuphda, for he was made a prisoner and beheaded
in 1412 (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>, ii, 124).</p>

<p>Eastern writers make no mention of the assistance rendered to
Faradj by Bajazet, upon the occasion of his struggle with his
father’s vassal at the commencement of his reign; but their silence
on this point is by no means conclusive as throwing doubt on the
statement, twice repeated, of Schiltberger, who was himself serving
in the force despatched by Bajazet to the support of the sultan, in
whom he hoped to secure an ally against Timour, whose power
menaced the safety of both. Had the two sultans been indeed of
one accord, the conqueror might have received a check. According
to Aboul-Mahazin (Weil, ii, 71), Timour is reported to have
said, on hearing of the death of Barkok: “Bajazet is an excellent
general, but his troops are not worth much; the Egyptians and
Syrians, however, are good soldiers, but they are badly handled”.
It is very certain that Bajazet, in his turn, soon afterwards (1400)
appealed for assistance to the sultan of Egypt, who refused to
grant it, because the former’s venture against Malatia was not
forgotten (Weil, 81, note 42); but the necessity he was under
of keeping his troops for protection at home, was the truer
cause.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

thousand horsemen sent by Weyasit.”—The walls of Sebaste, originally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>constructed by Aladin Kekobady, a Seljouk king, were of
extraordinary strength, being twenty cubits in height, and ten
cubits in thickness at the base, narrowing to six cubits at the top.
The place was stubbornly defended, the besieged being well supplied
with munitions of war; but the besiegers constructed towers
of greater height than the town, and planted upon them machines
for hurling huge stones, so that, at the expiration of 18 days (the
text says 21 days), the besieged sued for quarter. Timour spared
all the Mussulmans, but the Christians were sent into slavery.
The 4000 horsemen (5000 horsemen in the text) being Armenians,
were flung alive into pits and covered with earth (Petis de la
Croix, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Timur Bec</cite>, liv. v, 268).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_12" id="Footnote_2_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_12">(2.)</a> “There were also nine thousand virgins taken into captivity
by Tämerlin to his own country.”—The contemporary historians,
Aboul-Mahazin and Arabshah (Weil, 81), describe in like manner
the cruelties practised on the inhabitants of Sebaste in 1400,
by Timour, whose admirer even, Shereef uddin, differs but slightly
in the horrible details (Hammer, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de l’E. O.</cite>, ii, 59).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_13" id="Footnote_1_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_13">(1.)</a> “Scarcely had Tämerlin returned to his own country.”—After
the fall of Sebaste, Timour proceeded to Syria, where he
took several cities, Damascus being of the number; and having
recrossed the Euphrates, he entered Baghdad. Bajazet had in the
meantime seized upon Erzingan, which belonged to Taharten, who
had already acknowledged the supremacy of Timour; an act on
the part of the sultan which accelerated the struggle between
himself and Timour, and to which Schiltberger alludes in this
chapter. In chapters 14–19, he depicts the above-mentioned
campaigns and other expeditions of Timour, imagining that they
were conducted after the battle of Angora; but as he reports
from hearsay only, he was not in a position to form a correct idea
of the chronological order in which they occurred.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_13" id="Footnote_2_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_13">(2.)</a> “Tarathan.”—It is by the name of Tabarten that Eastern
writers know this prince, who, at that time, possessed the city of
Erzingan; whilst Clavigo, who enters into numerous details on the
private affairs of the “gran Caballero”, calls him Zaratan. The
residence of this ruler was near the Kara-sou, at that time the
great western arm of the Euphrates, at a place called by the
Turks, Erznga or Eznga, a name derived from the Armenian,
Eriza, as I am informed by Bishop Aïvazoffsky of the Armenian
church at Theodosia. According to Marco Polo, who called it
Arzinga (Yule, 2nd edit., i, 47), it was the capital of Greater
Armenia, Sis being that of Lesser Armenia. The apparent contradiction
in our author’s statements arises from the fact that, in
another chapter, he represents Sis, Erzingan, and Tiflis, as being the
chief towns of the three divisions of Armenia. The first belonged
to the sultan of Egypt; the others to the Timourides, actually to
Shah Rokh, the son of Timour. In ancient times, Erzingan was
celebrated for the temple of Anaïtis (Strabo, xi, 14, 16), destroyed
by St. Gregory the Enlightener. Procopius calls the place, Aurea
Comana, and tells us that it contained a temple of Artemis,
founded, according to tradition, by Orestes and Iphigenia; a
temple already transformed into a Christian church at the time
he wrote (<cite>De Bell. Pers.</cite>, i, 177; Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite>, etc., x, 774).</p>

<p>In quoting, together with Arzes and Erzingan, the fortress of
Chliat and Percri, Constantine Porphyrogenitus (<cite>De Adm. Imp.</cite>,
44, 8) referred to Akhlat or Gelath, and the modern town of
Pergri on the Bandoumaky, and not, as supposed by Ritter, to
the village of Bagaran or Pacaran, near the ruins of Ani, the
ancient capital of Armenia, close to the river Arpa-tchaï. Erzingan
was destroyed by the Mongols in 1242; in 1387, Taharten
acknowledged the suzerainty of Timour, and in 1400 he was expelled
by Bajazet, who, in his turn, lost the city to the Tatars.
It had not risen out of its ruins in the time of Barbaro, and now
they are scarcely to be traced. <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Etiam periere ruinæ!</cite>—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_13" id="Footnote_3_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_13">(3.)</a> “but he died on the way.”—Schiltberger’s silence with
regard to the cage in which Timour confined his captive, agrees,
says Neumann, with the result of the researches of Hammer, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>seeks to prove that the tale is the invention of a sworn enemy of
Timour. The Baron’s opinion is supported by the Russian Academician
Sresneffsky, in his quotation from a Russian chronicler
(Nikitin, in <cite>Hojdenye za try Mory’a</cite>), a contemporary of Timour,
who, in alluding to the fate of Ilderim, has not thought it necessary
to speak of the cage in which he was made to follow his conqueror.
Hammer’s argument does not appear to have satisfied
Weil (ii, 96), on the grounds that the story of the iron cage does
not emanate from Arabshah only, but also from other Arabian
chroniclers. Weil equally disputes the assertion that the term
cage was intended to signify a litter, and disagrees with Rehm
(iv, 3, 151) in his interpretation of the word <em>kafass</em>, that it implied
a litter as well as a cage, the Arabian word for the former
being <em>handedj</em>, <em>mahaffah</em>, and <em>kubbet</em>; and concludes by saying,
that if Bajazet was not really carried about in a cage, his litter
must have been of most peculiar construction.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_14" id="Footnote_1_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_14">(1.)</a> “The cities I have named are chief cities in Syria.”—These
cities in Syria fell into Timour’s hands in the year 1400, but
the order of their conquest, as given in the text, differs from the
records of Eastern writers. Aboul-Mahazin and Arabshah (Weil,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Chalifen</cite>, ii, 82) state, that the first to surrender was Behesna,
“Wehessum”; then the tower of Aïntab, “Anthap”, whence
Timour proceeded to Haleb, “Hallapp”, now Aleppo, which was
taken and dealt with as described by Schiltberger. According to
Shereef uddin, Timour Tash, the Egyptian amir and commander
of the place, met with the same fate as did the garrison; but
Arabshah says, that his life was not only spared, but he also received
a robe of honour. Finally, the conqueror seized upon the
fortress of Kalat Erroum—Fortress of the Romans—called “Hrumkula” in the text.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Hrhomgla, for “Hrumkula”, is the Armenian, as Ourroum
Kaleh is the Turkish, name of a now miserable village, situated
on the western bank of the Euphrates, at the confluence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>the river Marzeban. It is surmounted by a castellated building
on a high hill. It was a place of some importance from 1150 to
1298, as being the residence of the patriarchs of Armenia. Quoting
from Arabshah, Petis de la Croix (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Timur Bec</cite>, liv. v,
285) inserts a note to the effect that Timour left Calat Erroum
without attacking it, which he dared not do, because the place
was very strong.</p>

<p>Having regard to the geographical position of the places in this
part of Mesopotamia, taken by Timour in 1400, his road to conquest
must have lain thus—Behesna, Aïntab, Aleppo, Ourroum Kaleh.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_14" id="Footnote_2_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_14">(2.)</a> “And the city was pillaged.”—The Arabian authors, Aboul-Mahazin
and Ibn Khaldoun (Rashid-eddin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. des Mongols, etc.</cite>;
by Quatremère, 286), the latter being an eye-witness, are agreed
that Timour himself ordered the incendiarism of the mosque at
Damascus, but they make no mention of the cruelties imputed to
him by Schiltberger; they assert, on the contrary, that he very
graciously received the deputation headed by the kady, Taky
uddin ibn Mouflyk. Other writers have recorded, that Timour
was even anxious to save the mosque from the fire which had
broken out accidentally and destroyed the entire city. The magnificence
of the great “temple” at Damascus, as shown in the
text, is confirmed on the testimony of Eastern writers (Quatremère,
ii, 262) who state, that this edifice, considered as one of the
wonders of the world, had four gates. In saying that there were
as many as forty outer gates, Schiltberger no doubt included those
of the annexes which, together with the main building, were surrounded
by a wall having several entrances; this appears conclusive
on consulting an Arabian record quoted by Quatremère
(283), which represents that in front of the mosque were
many spacious porches, each of which conducted to a large gate,
etc. “The view of the buildings, of the domes, of the three minarets,
and water courses, as seen from the court, is admirable, and
a sight to startle the imagination.” There can be little doubt
that the gates were numerous, and that Schiltberger should have
estimated their number at forty is not to be wondered at, when
we consider the practice among Orientals of designating any large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>number
by the numeral forty, as, for instance, Kyrkyer, Kyrkeklesy,
etc.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(2<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) In Ibn Haukal’s time (10th century), the mosque at
Damascus was considered one of the largest and most ancient in
the land of the Mussulmans. Walid ben Abd-el-Melyk (the sixth
Omniade caliph, 705–715) had beautified it with pavements of
marble, and pillars of variegated marble the tops of which were
ornamented with gold and studded with precious stones. The
ceiling was covered with gold, and so great was the cost that the
revenues of Syria were expended on the work. Porter (<cite>Five Years
in Damascus</cite>, ii, 62) describes the quadrangle as being 163 yards
in length, 108 yards wide, and surrounded by a lofty wall of fine
masonry. The three sides of the cloister, in an adjoining court,
are supported by arches resting on pillars of limestone, marble, and
granite, and on the south side of the court is the <em>harem</em> (sacred
place), whose interior dimensions are 431 ft. by 125 ft. Two rows
of columns, 22 ft. in height, extend the whole length of the building
and support the triple roof. A transept across the middle, is
supported by eight massive piers of solid masonry, each 12 ft.
square, and a splendid dome, nearly 50 ft. in diameter and about
120 ft. in height, stands in the centre. The interior of the mosque
has a tesselated pavement of marble, and the walls of the transept
and the piers are coated with marble in beautiful patterns. According
to Arabshah (<cite>Vattier edition</cite>, v, 169), it was the Raphadites
or Shyites (see chap. xxxiii, <a href="#Footnote_2_33">note 3</a>, for this sect) of Khorasan who
set fire to this noble mosque, Timour being credited by various
authors, as stated in the preceding paragraph, with having wished
rather to save the edifice from destruction. Much as records may
differ, Schiltberger’s relation, so graphic and detailed, merits the
fullest consideration.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_14" id="Footnote_3_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_14">(3.)</a>  “Scherch.”—On March 19, 1400, Timour proceeded from
Damascus by way of Roha (the ancient Edessa near Orfa), Mardin,
and Mosoul to Baghdad (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 91), after having
despatched flying columns hither and thither to forage, some of his
people reaching even to the neighbourhood of Antioch. A portion of
his forces must therefore have crossed the Antilibanus, called Jabal—mountain—also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>Shurky, which may have been the “Scherch”
mentioned in the text.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_15" id="Footnote_1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_15">(1.)</a>  “and the king kept his treasure there.”—This, in all probability,
is the fortress of Alinjy or Alindsha, some miles to the
south of Nahitchevan. In 1394, Ahmed ben Oweis sent thither his
family and treasure, and it was not until the year 1401 that this
fortress was taken by Timour’s troops, whilst he himself was laying
siege to Baghdad with the bulk of his army. Faradj, who had
been left in command by Ahmed, was forced to surrender, after a
valorous defence of forty days. All the inhabitants were massacred,
and the place was completely destroyed with the exception of the
schools, mosques, and hospitals (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, 93). After
taking Baghdad, July 9, 1401, Timour passed through Tabreez, on
his way to Karabagh, where he purposed spending the winter,
occupying the cities of Roha, Mardin, and Mosoul on his march.
It would appear that it is to these places Schiltberger refers, but
he has fallen into error in saying that they were taken after the
capture of Baghdad—a mistake to be accounted for, from his not
having served in the expedition.<a name="FNanchor_1_15a" id="FNanchor_1_15a"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15a" class="fnanchor">1</a>—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_16" id="Footnote_1_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_16">(1.)</a>  “Lesser India.”—Under this name Schiltberger includes
the northern portion of the peninsula on this side of the Ganges,
giving to the southern part the designation of Greater India.
Marco Polo (Yule, ii, 416, 417) employs the same names, but in
another sense. His Lesser India included Kesmacoran (Kij-Makrau,
<i>i.e.</i>, Makran), to the whole Coromandel coast inclusive. Greater
India extended from the Coromandel coast to Cochin China—Middle
India being Abyssinia. Timour’s expedition into India (1398)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>was conducted to the banks of the Indus from Samarkand, by way
of Inderab and Cabul. On crossing the river near Kalabagh, he
passed by way of Mooltan to Delhi, which he occupied, conducting
himself as was his custom on such occasions; but Schiltberger makes
no allusion to the cruelties he practised. Perhaps because the
details of the expedition were related to him by the Mongols
themselves, and not by their enemies, the Arabs and Persians.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_16" id="Footnote_2_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_16">(2.)</a>  “and it is of half a day’s journey.”—We are evidently given
to understand here, that the narrow defile through which Timour
had to pass, was the famous Iron Gate, at all times considered the
frontier limit of India and Turania. In the year 328 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, Alexander
of Macedon made his way through this passage, described by his
historians in language identical to that of Schiltberger ... “sed
aditus specus accipit lucem, interiora obscura sunt”.... (Curtius,
viii, 8, 19). Very similar is the testimony of the several Oriental
writers quoted in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Centralasiatische Studien (Sitzungsberichte
d. Kais. Akad. d. Wissenschaften</cite>, lxxxvii, 1, 67, 184) by M. Tomaschek,
who has availed himself of the results of the Russian expedition
to Hissar (<cite>Ysvest. Imp. Geog. Obshtchest.</cite>, xii, 70, 1876, 349–363)
to determine the exact locality of the Iron Gate. There may
have been near the Iron Gate, in Schiltberger’s time, as there is
now, a “Winterdorf” (Tomaschek, l. c.) called Darbend or Derbent,
but it is not of this “kishlak”, but rather of the city of Derbent,
in the Caucasus, that Clavijo observes, after stating that the
possessions of Timour extended from the Iron Gates situated near
Derbent, to those in the land of Samarkand:—“E Darbante es
una muy gran ciudad que se cuenta su señorio con una grande
tierra, é las primeras destas puertas, que son mas cerca de nos,
se llaman las puertas del Fierro de cerca Darbante, é las otras
postrimeras se llaman las puertas del Fierro cerca Termit, que
confinan con il terreno de la India menor.” I prefer giving this
extract in the original.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_16" id="Footnote_3_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_16">(3.)</a>  “the lord Tämerlin is come.” The correct rendering of
this passage is “Amir Timour gheldy.”—The Amir Timour is
come.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_16" id="Footnote_4_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_16">(4.)</a>  “and of the elephants many were killed.”—This incident
is corroborated by Clavijo (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>, 153), who places at
fifty the number of armed elephants opposed to Timour in the
battle near Delhi. The contest being renewed on the second day,
“Timour took many camels, and loaded them with dry grass,
placing them in front of the elephants. When the battle began,
he caused the grass to be set on fire, and when the elephants saw
the burning straw upon the camels, they fled. They say that the
elephants are much afraid of fire because they have small eyes.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_17" id="Footnote_1_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_17">(1.)</a>  “Soltania.”—Or Soultanyà—Royal city—so named by Oljaïtou,
son of Arghoun Khan, the founder (1305), once the metropolis
and largest city in the kingdom. Chardin (<cite>Langlès edition</cite>,
ii, 377) tells us that there were not many cities in the world where
vaster ruins were to be seen; and in Kinnear’s time (<cite>Geog. Mem. of
the Persian Emp.</cite>, 123) the place was reduced to a few wretched
hovels. Colonel Yule (Marco Polo, ii, 478) reproduces from Fergusson
an illustration of the tomb built for himself by Oljaïtu, or as his Moslem
name ran, Mahomed Khodabandah, at Soultaniah, “the finest
work of architecture that the ‘Tartars of the Levant’ have left behind
them.” Kinnear describes it as being a large and beautiful
structure ninety feet in height, built of brick, and covered with a
cupola—an edifice that would do honour to the most scientific
architect in Europe.</p>

<p>This tomb of Oljaïtou was still magnificent, and especially
noted for its colossal gates of damasked steel, even so late as the
seventeenth century. “The city was reoccupied by some of the
Persian kings in the sixteenth century, till Shah Abbas transferred
the seat of government to Ispahan. John XXII set up an archbishopric
at Sultaniah in 1318, in favour of Francis of Perugia, a
Dominican, and the series of archbishops is traced down to 1425.”

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_18" id="Footnote_1_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_18">(1.)</a>  “and they were all trampled upon.”—This atrocious
conduct on the part of Timour, is not the creation of Schiltberger’s
brain, but it cannot have reference to the capture of Ispahan in
1387, although it is possible that the evolutions of Timour’s
horsemen against children, was repeated after the fall of Ephesus
in 1403; this act of cruelty being imputed to him by several
Oriental authors. His return to Samarkand from Ephesus, actually
took place after an absence of at least seven, if not twelve years
(Rehm, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Mittelalt.</cite>, iv, 3, 78); and he went there immediately
after taking Ispahan in 1387. Schiltberger’s details on
the revolt of that city under the farrier, Aly Koutchava, and on
the construction of the tower of human heads by order of Timour,
agree with similar accounts from other sources.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_19" id="Footnote_1_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_19">(1.)</a>  “because it was very cold in that country.”—Timour was
desirous of adding China to the rest of his conquests, and had even
embarked on an expedition, placing himself at the head of a large
army; but he fell ill of fever upon reaching Otrar, and died February
19, 1405.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Other authorities state Timour’s death to have occurred
the 17 Shabran, 807 (February 17, 1405).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_21" id="Footnote_1_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_21">(1.)</a>  “with whom I also remained.”—Pir Mohammed, son of
Jehangir, the eldest son of Timour, died in 1375. Shah Rokh
was the youngest of the two sons mentioned by Schiltberger. After
the death, in 1410, of Khoulyl son of Miran Shah, the successor of
Pir Mohammed who died in 1407, Shah Rokh annexed Transoxana
and Samarkand to his possessions, and reigned until 1446.
After saying that he had remained with this sovereign at Herat,
Schiltberger adds that it was under Miran Shah he served; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>afterwards tells us that he only went over to the latter after Shah
Kokh had vanquished Kara Youssouf, ruler of the Turkomans of
the Black Sheep.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_22" id="Footnote_1_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_22">(1.)</a>  “Scharabach.”—According to Bishop Aïvazoffsky, this plain
of “Scharabach” is to be identified with the plain of Karabagh,
near the town of Bajazid, in Asiatic Turkey. Neumann is of a
different opinion, and points to the district of Karabagh, which
extends to the east of Shirwan, as far as the junction of the Kour
with the Araxes, anciently called Arzah by the Armenians. Whether
the battle of “Scharabach” was fought in Georgia or in Turkey,
there is every probability that Schiltberger was made a prisoner
upon the occasion, as was also his “lord”. It would never otherwise
have occurred to him to say, that he was turned over to Aboubekr

actually succumbed in his struggle with Youssouf or Joseph (Dorn,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch. einer Gesch. d. Schirwan-Sch.</cite>, VI, iv, 579). His eldest
brother, Miszr Khodja (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 46) had defended
the city of Van against Timour in 1394, but contemporary authors
do not say whether it was he who put Jehangir to death in 1375.
Miszr Khodja may have caused the death of another son of Timour,
whom Schiltberger has confounded with Jehangir. Perhaps that of
Omar Sheykh, upon the nature of whose death authors are not
agreed; Rehm (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tab. gen. des Timurides</cite>, v. iv) stating that he died in
1427 only, and Hammer (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de l’E. O.</cite>, ii, 37) alluding to his
sudden death, as having taken place at about the time of the conquest
of Van, by Timour, <i>circa</i> 1394.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_23" id="Footnote_1_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_23">(1.)</a>  “Achtum.”—The author says nothing of the neighbourhood
of Nahitchevan, for which Neumann gives him credit, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>of that of Erzeroum, which Bishop Aïvazoffsky believes to be the
site of the battle of “Achtum”, upon which occasion the Ilkhan
Ahmed was defeated by Kara Youssouf. In the plain of “Achtum”
we recognise the environs of Aktam, where Timour halted when
returning from his last expedition against Toktamish (Dorn, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch.
einer Gesch. d. Schirwan-Sch.</cite>, 567; Price, <cite>Chron. Retros.</cite>, iii,
206, who says of Acataem or Actem, that it is a station to the
eastward of Moghaun). Neumann agrees with Hammer that
Ahmed ben Oweïs was beheaded in 1410, and this is also the
opinion of Weil (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 141); but Dorn (<i>ibid.</i>, 573)
has it, that his conflict with Kara Youssouf did not take place
until the year 815 = 1412.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_24" id="Footnote_1_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_24">(1.)</a>  “Abubachir had also a brother called Mansur.”—Besides
this Mansour, for whose name I have searched in vain in the
various works I have been able to consult, Aboubekr had another
brother named Mirza Omar, upon whom Timour bestowed the
throne of Houlakou, and who fell out with his elder brother, the
said Aboubekr, and had him confined in a fortress (Dorn, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch.
einer Gesch. d. Schirwan-Sch.</cite>, 570). Aboubekr afterwards obtained
his freedom, and succeeded in ridding himself of “Mansur”, to
punish him, in all probability, for making common cause with
Omar.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_25" id="Footnote_1_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_25">(1.)</a>  “Samabram.”—Ibn Haukal describes Shabran as being, in
his time, a small place, but “pleasant, and well supplied with
provisions”. This town appears as Sabran, in Castaldo’s map,
1584, and De Wit’s atlas, 1688, and is called Schabran by
Olearius (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyages</cite>, etc., 1038). It has now totally disappeared, its
ruins being on the Shabran-tchaï, a small river flowing into the
lake Ak-Sibir on the Caspian shore.</p>

<p>Schiltberger states that the prince passed through “Strana”,
“Gursey”, “Lochinschan”, “Schurban”, “Samabram”, and “Temurtapit”;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>but as the king’s son was sent for, to return forthwith
to his own country, it is more probable that he selected a short
route, in which case he would have travelled, if the names are
here correctly interpreted, through Astara, Shirwan, Shabran,
Georgia, Lezghistan, and the Iron Gate, undoubtedly Derbent,
which divided Persia from Tatary.</p>

<p>“Strana” I take to be intended for Astara, for the following
reasons. It is stated in the last chapter, that Aboubekr took a
country called “Kray”; probably Kars, which had been occupied
by Timour in 1393, after laying siege to the fortress of
Alindsha. Aboubekr than proceeded to “Erban”, Erivan, where
he seized upon his brother “Mansur”, and strangled him.
“Zegra”, being with Aboubekr, was therefore apparently in
Armenia, and must have travelled northwards by keeping close
to the Caspian, instead of traversing the heart of the Christian
kingdom of Georgia.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_25" id="Footnote_2_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_25">(2.)</a>  “Temurtapit.”—According to Sprengel (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der wichtigsten
Geog. Entd.</cite>, etc., 362, 99), the Iron Gate through which
the author passed when on his way from Persia into Tatary, was
not the Iron Gate at Derbent, in the Caucasus, but the Caspian
Gate in Khorasan. Malte Brun (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Précis de la Géog. Univ.</cite>, i, 188)
and Sreznevsky (<cite>Hojdenye za try mory’a</cite>, etc., 241) are of similar
opinion, while Neumann has no doubt that the Gate of Derbent,
called Demyr kapou, Iron Gate, by the Turks, is the “ysen tor”
of the text, which, had it been other than that at Derbent, would
hardly have been described as being near Georgia and Shabran.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_25" id="Footnote_3_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_25">(3.)</a>  “a river called Edil.”—Neumann attempts, but in vain, to
identify the city of “Origens”, described as being in the middle of
the river “Edil”, with Astrahan, although it is clear that the
author was not ignorant of the real name of the latter place, Hadjy-tarkhan
being included among the cities he visited in Tatary
(“Haitzicherchen”, see <a href="#Page_49">Chapter 36</a>). It is not even necessary to
conclude that “Origens”, like Astrahan, was bathed by the waters
of the Volga, though the Turk name of that river is actually Etel,
or Edil, a designation that may have been applied to some other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>river, because Schiltberger states elsewhere (Chap. 36) that
“Orden”, Ourjenj, the chief town of “Horosaman”, Khwarezm,
was situated near the “Edil”, and it cannot be doubted that he
there alludes to the Jyhoun, or Oxus, and not to the Volga.</p>

<p>The first large river the author got to after leaving Derbent,
was the Terek; we are, therefore, at liberty to suppose that
“Origens” was in the delta of that river. Güldenstadt (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reisen durch
Russl.</cite>, i, 166) informs us that the vestiges of the ancient cities of
Terki and Kopaï-Kala—now known as Guen-kala, the Burnt
Fortress, were close to that locality, and that near the mouth of
the river were other ruins, which he took to be those of the cities
of Tumen and Bortchala, or “the town of the three walls”. It is
certain that in these parts must have been the residence of the
Khozar kings, called Semender, or Saraï-Banou—the lady’s palace—Hammer,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. G. H.</cite>, 8) distant a four days’ journey only from
Derbent, but a seven days’ journey from the Itil (Dorn, <cite>Géog.
Cauc.</cite> in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mém. de l’Ac. de St. P.</cite>, vi, ser. vii, 527), which is equal
to the twenty farsangs that separated this city from the great
river Varshan, or Orshan, alluded to in the celebrated letter of
the king of the Khozars to the minister of Abdor-Rahmen III.
(D’Ohsson, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Peup. du Cauc.</cite>, Par. 828, p. 208.) In these
same parts, also, should be placed the residence of the Tchamkal,
known to the natives by a name that it was found impossible to
pronounce. This name, so difficult of pronunciation, may have
been transformed by Schiltberger into “Origens”, seeing that
Russian annalists have construed it into Ornatch or Arnatch, evidently
to be identified with Tenex or Ornacia (Ornatia, Oruntia,
Cornax, Tornax). The monk Alberic (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rel. de Jean du Plan de
Carpin</cite>, 114) tells us that this city was taken by the Mongols
in 1221, upon the occasion of their irruption into the territory
of the Comans and Russians, a city apparently identical
with Ornas, “civitas Ornarum”, inhabited by Russians, Alans, and
other Christians, but belonging to the Saracens. It was completely
destroyed by the hordes of Batou, before their invasion of
the country of the Russians and Turks (Turcorum, Taycorum, and
Tortorum), as we learn from Giovanni dal Piano di Carpine and
his travelling companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>It is to be regretted that, whilst admitting the identity of this
city under its various denominations, authors are unable to agree
as to its site. Karamsin, D’Avezac, and Kunik are in support of
Thunmann’s theory, that it was Tana, the modern Azoff. Others,
Leontief (Propilei, iv), for instance, are in favour of Frachn’s (Ibn
Foszlan, 162) opinion that the Oruntia of Alberic, the Ornas of
Giovanni dal Piano di Carpine, and the Arnatch of the Russian
chroniclers, were all identical with the Ourjenj of Khorasan. I
did at one time support these views, but have since sought to
prove (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sitzungsberichte d. Kön. Bay. Akad.</cite>, 1869, ii, 276 <i>et seq.</i>)
that the city in question was equidistant from Azoff and Ourjenj,
or, in other words, that it coincided with “Origens”, situated, as
we read in the text, on the “Edil”, a great river, viz., the Terek.
It is pretty clear that “Origens”, and Ornatch or Arnatch of the
Russians, are corruptions of Anjadz or Anjak, which, according
to Khanikoff (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoire sur Khâcâni</cite>, vi, v) was a port in the
Caspian Sea near Astrahan, of which the people of the eastern
provinces near the Caspian might have availed themselves for the
purpose of penetrating into Southern Russia.</p>

<p>There can scarcely, however, be a doubt that the city of “Origens”
must be looked for near the Caucasus, seeing that Schiltberger
quitted it just before entering the mountains of “Setzulet”,
manifestly the “Zulat”, which we are told in Chapter 36 was the
chief city of the mountainous country of “Bestan”. We cannot
fail to recognise in this “Setzulet”, or “Zulat”, the city of Joulad,
where Timour, in 1395, gained a signal victory over Toktamish,
after having annihilated a body of Kaitaks near Terky or Tarkou.
Little enough is left to attest to the ancient splendour of Joulad,
situated on the Terek, at no great distance from Yekaterynograd;
but Güldenstadt found in its neighbourhood numerous remains,
including Christian monuments, chiefly at a place called
Tatar Toup—Hill of Tatars. Klaproth (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. au Caucase et en
Géorgie</cite>, ii, 161) saw three minarets standing, that greatly resembled
others at Joulad; also the ruins of two churches, which
he attributes, as does Güldenstadt, to the 16th century, and to the
Greek faith, whilst admitting the assertion of the Circassians, that
those edifices were constructed by Franks, that is to say, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>Europeans from the West, who had taken up their residence
among the Tatars. This is confirmed by Barbaro (<cite>Ramusio
edition</cite>, 109). “Caitacchi i quali sono circa il monte Caspio ...
parlano idioma separate da gli altri. sono christiani molti di loro:
dei quali parte fanno alla Greca, parte all’Armena, et alcuni alla
Catholica.” In the face of such evidence, it is not strange that
Schiltberger should have met, to the north of the great range of
the Caucasus, a Christian bishop and Carmelites who worshipped
in the Tatar tongue, although the Carmelites, an order of friars
originated at Mount Carmel, were not introduced into Europe by
St. Louis until the year 1328; and in alluding to the mountainous
country of “Bestan”, in which was the city of Joulad, the Bishtag—Five
mountains—where Ibn Batouta (<cite>Lee edition</cite>, 76) met
the Khan Uzbek, Schiltberger must have had in view the environs
of Yekaterynograd, still called Beshtamak, because the country is
watered by five tributaries to the Terek (Klaproth, i, 327).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_25" id="Footnote_4_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_25">(4.)</a>  “Zegre.”—This “Zegre” or “Zeggra”, was in all probability
Tchekre, coins of whose reign, struck in 1414–1416, at casual
encampments—at Bolgar, Astrahan, and Saraï, are preserved (Savelieff,
<cite>Mon. Joud.</cite>, ii, 337).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_25" id="Footnote_5_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_25">(5.)</a>  “savages, that had been taken in the mountain.”—This
couple may have been brought from northern Siberia, where the
rigorous nature of the climate compelled the natives to wear, by
night and by day, as they do now, clothing made of the skins of
animals. Schiltberger somewhat assimilates them to monkeys,
which reminds us of Herodotus, who described the Neurians as
being transformed into wolves, during six months of the year, because
they were in all probability clothed in wolf-skins, so long as
winter lasted.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_25" id="Footnote_6_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_25">(6.)</a>  “Ugine.”—One is liable at first sight to identify the
“Ugine” with the Ung of Marco Polo (Yule, i, 276), whom he
distinguishes from the Mongols proper; “two races of people that
existed in that province (Tenduc) before the migration of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>Tartars. <em>Ung</em> was the title of the people of the country, and
<em>Mungul</em> a name sometimes applied to the Tartars.” Pauthier
(Marco Polo, i, 218) explains, that by Ung are meant the Keraits,
or subjects of Prester John, so named because, like them, he was
a Nestorian. A descendant of this Prester John, named George,
mentioned by Marco Polo, was converted to Catholicism by Giovanni
di Montecorvino, who had numerous partisans in China
during the stay in that country of Giovanni de Marignolli (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reis.
in das Morgenl.</cite>, 41); Pauthier is therefore of opinion that, in
Schiltberger’s time, there were Christian Ung in Northern Asia,
who, if not Catholics, were perhaps Nestorians. There could
scarcely, however, have been anything in common between the
Ung and the “Ugine”, for the author says that, although they
worshipped the infant Jesus, they were not Christians; and this he
makes more explicit in Chap. 45, where he includes them among
the five classes of infidels known to him, being those who confessed
the three kings before receiving baptism. None of the three kings
became the founder of any religion whatsoever. Neumann’s views
may, therefore, be accepted, viz., that Schiltberger alludes to
Buddhism, introduced among the Mongols by Jengiz from Thibet.
I should consequently prefer to associate the “Ugine”, not with
the Keraits, but with the great Turk tribe, the Ung-kut, in whom
Colonel Yule (Marco Polo, i, 285) recognises the real Ung of
Marco Polo.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_26" id="Footnote_1_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_26">(1.)</a>  “but he was killed in a battle.”—Tchadibek Khan was
raised to the throne by Ydegou or Edekou in 1399, upon the
death of his brother, Timour Koutlouh. The coins struck during
his reign and Russian chronicles show, that his rule lasted until
1407, in the early part of which year Toktamish died near Tioumen,
in Siberia, whither he had retired after his defeat by Ydegou and
Timour Koutlouh in 1399. Clavijo says that he had effected a
reconciliation with Timour, who desired to oppose him to Ydegou,
the latter having refused to acknowledge his suzerainty. Upon his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>return from Siberia, Ydegou quarrelled with Tchadibek, who did
not lose his life, but fled to the Caucasus, never again to return
to the Horde—a statement which, though at variance with Schiltberger’s
narrative, is based on a coin of the reign of Tchadibek,
struck at Shemahà. Of this coin, Savelieff (<cite>Mon. Joud.</cite>, ii, 225)
says, “It certifies that although Tchadibek’s influence in the Horde
was lost to him, he contrived to enjoy an appanage in the Caucasus.”
But this unique coin might have been struck when Tchadibek was
still at Saraï, for we learn from Dorn (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch. einer Gesch. d.
Schirwan-Sch.</cite>, 572) that prayers were offered at Shirwan in the
name of Tchadibek, and in the presence of Ydegou so late as the
year 1406, and nothing can force us to admit that the same
honours would have been paid to the khan after his expulsion by
that same amir, or that an appanage would have been bestowed
upon him in the Caucasus.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_26" id="Footnote_2_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_26">(2.)</a>  “Polet, who reigned one year and a half.”—Schiltberger
may have slightly shortened the duration of the reign of this khan,
who was the son of Timour Koutlouh, and was placed on the
throne by Ydegou, as successor to Tchadibek. His coins, struck at
Saraï, Bolgar, and Astrahan, prove that he must have reigned in
Kiptchak from 1407 to 1410, when he was expelled by Jalal uddin,
the “Segelalladin” of the text, who was the son of Toktamish.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_26" id="Footnote_3_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_26">(3.)</a>  “Thebachk, who fought with him for the kingdom and
killed him.”—It is stated in Penzel’s Edition (1814) of Schiltberger,
that Tamir, the brother of Polet, reigned fourteen months
and was then expelled by Jalal uddin, who occupied the throne for
a like period, fourteen months, and was then deposed by his brother,
“Thebachk”. Coins and annals establish the fact of the existence
of a brother of Poulad, named Timour, who, having ruled in the
Crimea in 1407, forcibly seized upon the throne of the Golden
Horde in 1411, and was dethroned the following year by Jalal
uddin, the Zelenii Soultann of the Russian annalists (Savelieff, <cite>Mon.
Joud.</cite>, ii, 329), who would not be entitled to reproach Schiltberger
for the free and easy manner in which he deals with the names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>the suzerain lords. The brother and murderer of Jalal uddin,
named “Thebachk” in the text, was probably no other than Kepak,
some of whose coins, struck at Bolgar and Astrahan, are preserved,
but the year is unfortunately wanting. Chroniclers make no
mention of this prince, attributing the death of Jalal uddin to
another brother, Kerym byrdy, who, according to our author, must
in his turn have been expelled by “Thebachk”; yet Russian
annalists have asserted that Kerym byrdy was killed by another
brother, whose name was Yerym ferdyn or Yarym ferden. From
the resemblance of the name Jebbar or Tchebbar, by which he was
known to Mussulman authors, to that of his elder brother Kepek,
Schiltberger may have mistaken the former for the latter, calling
him also “Thebachk”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_26" id="Footnote_4_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_26">(4.)</a>  “and he fought with Machmet and was killed.”—It is not
determined when and where Tchekre’s career terminated, because
Eastern and other authors are silent on the disastrous attempt
made by this prince to recover the throne from which he had been
overthrown by Oulou Mohammed, the great Mohammed, whose
origin is uncertain. The author informs us that the death of
Tchekre occurred subsequently to the struggle Mohammed had to
sustain, first, in his conflict with “Waroch”, and afterwards with
“Doblabardi”. It is evident that in the latter name we have
Devlett byrdy, son of Timour Tash, and grandson of Oulou
Mohammed, whilst “Waroch” stands for Borrak, son of Ourous
Khan, who fled to Oulouk Bek, the son of Shah Rokh in 1424,
the same year in which he expelled Oulou Mohammed, that is to
say about three years before Schiltberger’s return to his own
country. It is certain that all the author relates, having reference
to the Golden Horde, took place during his captivity, so that
the proof of Tchekre’s death having taken place between the years
1424 and 1427 is unquestionable; and it is not in the last, but in
one of the two preceding years that Devlett byrdy’s reign of three
days should be determined, notwithstanding that coins of this
prince, struck in 1427, have been recovered, for there is little
enough likelihood of the opportunity having been afforded him for
issuing a fresh coinage during a three days’ reign, especially as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>anarchy pervaded the Horde. There would have been nothing
extraordinary in his again dethroning his grandfather after
the death of Tchekre, and retaining the sovereignty for a longer
period.</p>

<p>The author’s relation of his own lot, after Tchekre’s first defeat
by Oulou Mohammed, is by no means clear, for it is not easy to
determine whether he accompanied Tchekre on his flight, or followed
the fortunes of Ydegou, upon his being made a prisoner.
As to the ultimate fate of this king-maker, opinions are divided.
Hammer (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. G. H.</cite>, 382) writes that in 1423 he was still
the sovereign of an independent state on the shores of the Black
Sea, and must have perished either in the war with Kadyr byrdy,
son of Toktamish, or he may have been drowned in the Jaxartes.
According to another source (Berezin, <cite>Yarlik Toktamysha</cite>, 61), he
was killed by a Tatar of the Barin tribe, from whom his head was
stolen by a friend, who, having presented it to Oulou Mohammed,
received in recompense that prince’s daughter in marriage.</p>

<p>That Schiltberger and Ydegou both actually fell into the hands
of Oulou Mohammed, seems more probable, because the author
speaks of the latter as his master, “min herr Machmet”; but it is not
easy to understand why he should have stated in another place
(chap. 67), that after Tchekre’s escape he had for his master one
of the old councillors of that prince, a certain “Manstzusch”, whose
name at least reminds us of one of the chief princes of the Golden
Horde (Hammer, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. G. H.</cite>, 391), the Manshuk killed in
1440 by Koutchouk Mohammed, Mohammed the Less, the
vanquisher of Mohammed the Great.</p>

<p>When, at a later period, Tchekre again sought to dispute the
throne with Mohammed, he probably entered into negotiations with
this ex-councillor, who would have quitted the country for the
express purpose upon the fall of the Pretender. In any case
“Manstzusch” left Kiptchak a short time only before Schiltberger’s
escape, because the latter was never separated from his master
until after his return from Egypt, where he had assisted at the
marriage of the daughter of Sultan Boursbaï—a sovereign who
ascended the throne in 1422 only. If, as I have endeavoured to
show, Schiltberger was at that time in “Manstzusch’s” service, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>very possible that the latter took him to Egypt, whither he may
have been sent by Oulou Mohammed, perhaps to congratulate
Boursbaï upon his accession, or for some other purpose.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

Melyka, the first of queens; the queen who is prudent above all
others. But Sadry is a woman’s name in Persia, and amongst

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_28" id="Footnote_2_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_28">(2.)</a>  “Bassaw.”—This is the Slave name for the city of Kronstadt
in Transylvania, the chief city in Burzelland. It is situated
near the river Burtzel or Burzel, a name given, according to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>geographers (Vosgien, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dict. Géog.</cite>, i, 157), to the territory through
which it flows. This name may, however, owe its origin to Bortz,
a Coman chief, who is mentioned in a Brief of Pope Gregory IX.,
dated 1227, addressed to the archbishop of Gran: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nuper siquidem
per litteras tuas nobis transmissas accepimus quod I. Ch. d. ac

(Theiner, <cite>Vet. Mon. Hist. Hung.</cite>, i, 86.) This prince did certainly
seek a refuge in Transylvania, as did many of his countrymen,
upon the irruption of the Mongols into Kiptchak. We have it
upon the authority of Mussulman writers, that among the eleven
Coman tribes settled in this country, were the Bourtch-oglon;
evidently subject to the princes Bourtchevitch mentioned in
Russian annals (Berezin, <cite>Nashestvye Mongolov</cite>, ix, 240).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_29" id="Footnote_1_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_29">(1.)</a>  “Kallacercka.”—The author does not here allude either to
Galata, as Jirecek (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Bulgaren</cite>, 324) supposes, or to Callatis,
as believed by Fallmerayer, but rather to the castle of Kaliakra,
the ruins of which are still visible on the headland of that name.
It is the Τιριστρία ἄκρα of the ancients, marked Caliacra in the
charts of the 14th century, and known as Γαλιάγρα in the <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta
Patriarch. Constant.</cite>, i, 52, 272. Evliya Effendi (<cite>Travels</cite>, etc., 70–72)
having been shipwrecked near the coast of Kilghra, when on
his voyage from Balaklava to Constantinople, in 1643, was hospitably
entertained by the dervishes of the monastery, near the
castle which was then in existence. In 1406, this territory belonged
to Mirtcha (Jirecek, 346); but ten years later he ceded his
possessions south of the Danube to his suzerain lord, the Sultan
Mahomet I.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_29" id="Footnote_2_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_29">(2.)</a>  “Salonikch.”—Schiltberger may have touched at Salonica
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>when upon his voyage to Egypt, referred to in chap, xxvi, note 4—performed,
in all probability, on board of an Italian vessel from
Caffa, upon which occasion he passed the island of Imbros, described
in chap. 58. There is no evidence whatever that he went
to Salonica after his return from Asia to Constantinople, nor is it
at all probable that he stopped there when being carried away
into slavery after the battle of Nicopolis, notwithstanding that the
town belonged to the Turks and not to the Greeks (Zinkeisen,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. O. R.</cite>, i, 287). Bajazet would scarcely have selected so
circuitous a route for sending captives to Broussa.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for surmising that the voyage was performed
in a Venetian vessel which touched at Salonica. This
town, given up in 1403 by Souleiman, son of Bajazet, to the Greeks,
was by them sold, in 1423, to the Venetians, who would undoubtedly
have taken all necessary measures for putting it into a
state of defence and supplying it with provisions, including salted
fish from the Sea of Azoff. Another reason for the supposition
that Schiltberger’s journey into Egypt could not have taken place
earlier than 1423, is to be found in the fact that, from Egypt he
passed over into Arabia, on a pilgrimage to the holy places of the
Mahomedans, having, as it would seem, turned Mussulman through
compulsion; and if he has avoided all reference to the journey, it
was out of a natural desire not to be reminded of the painful circumstance
of his apostacy.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_29" id="Footnote_3_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_29">(3.)</a>  “from whose grave oil flows.”—Hammer observes that Schiltberger
confirms the story told of St. Demetrius, and not of St.
Theodora, as erroneously related in Anagnosta’s <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Thessalonicensi
excidio narratio</cite>, the fact being, that the tomb of St. Theodora was
close to that of St. Demetrius, from whose foot flowed the oil
which was collected annually, and distributed to all believers
(<cite>Pout. Rouss. loud.</cite>, 47). Professor Grigorovitch tells us that the
well is still shewn beneath the floor of the church, but he was unable
to certify that the miracle continued to be operated!—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_29" id="Footnote_4_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_29">(4.)</a>  “Asia.”—Fallmerayer and Hammer maintain that Schiltberger
was mistaken in saying that the city in which was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>tomb of St. John, was called Asia, the correct name being Ephesus,
known to the Turks as Aisulugh, and as Ἅγιος Θεολόγος to the
Byzantines, who thus styled St. John. The author’s learned
countrymen might, however, have admitted in his justification the
evidence of Codinus (<cite>Urb. nom. imm.</cite>, 316), to the effect that the
ancient name of the eparchiate of Ephesus was Ἀσία ἡ Ἔφεσος.
Schiltberger may have learnt the ancient name from the monks,
who would have employed it in those days.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(4<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) The church at Ephesus, erected over the tomb of St. John
the Evangelist, was enlarged by Justinian, and afterwards turned
into a mosque (Ibn Batouta). Here, also, as at the grave of St.
Demetrius at Salonica, the mortal remains were invested with
miraculous powders, for a peculiar kind of dust, in substance like
flour, and compared by St. George of Tours to manna, worked its
way out of the sepulchre, and being taken about, effected many
marvellous cures (Baillet, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vie des Saints</cite>, viii, 624).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_29" id="Footnote_5_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_29">(5.)</a>  “Saint Nicholas was bishop there.”—St. Nicholas, the patron
of Russia, was bishop of Myra in Lycia, which the author confounds
with Ismir, the Turkish name for Smyrna. De Lannoy
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 4) commits a similar error in quoting Lisemiere,
together with Feule la vielle for Fogliavecchia, and Porspic for
porto di Spiga.</p>

<p>Smyrna, a possession of the knights of Rhodes, was taken by
Timour towards the close of the year 1402 (Hammer, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de
l’E. O.</cite>, ii, 116), upon which occasion Schiltberger must have
visited it, without, however, having been afforded the opportunity
of seeing the picturesque valley where Fellows, in 1838 (<cite>Travels and
Researches in Asia Minor</cite>, etc.), discovered the imposing ruins of
Myra, or Demir, so called by the Turks. It is recorded that in
1087, the relics of St. Nicholas were removed to Bari, and the
church in which they were originally laid having fallen to ruins, a
small chapel was erected on the site. The restoration of the sacred
edifice, completed in 1874 at a cost of 10,000 roubles, was commenced
on the initiative of M. Mouravieff.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

have been discovered near a village called Aïneh-bazar, distant sixteen
miles from Ephesus. The former, the Manissa of the Turks,
near the Hermus at the foot of Mount Sipylus, has ever been a
city noted for its extent, commerce, and population.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

time of Hadjy Khalpha, was no longer included in the district of
Saroukhan, but was added to that of Koutahieh. Near this place,
pleasantly situated in a rich and well-watered plain, are the ruins
of Laodicea, one of the Seven Churches to which St. John addressed
his Revelations.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

ancient Gangra, is the principal in the district. In the days of
Hadjy Khalpha, it contained a fortress and an imperial residence,
which must have been in existence in Schiltberger’s time, and accounts
for his addition of the word saraï—palace—to Kiankary,
and thus converting the name to “Wegureisari”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

were never disturbed; the Abbey of St. Philibert at Tournes
in Burgundy, the cities of Bruges, St. Armand in Flanders, and
Rome, each claim the possession, but how they came by them is

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_31" id="Footnote_1_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_31">(1.)</a>  “Then he left her.”—Virgin’s towers are by no means uncommon
in the East. Rich (<cite>Residence in Kourdistan</cite>, i, 172) mentions
a Kiz-Kalesi—girl’s castle—as being on a hill above the Kizzeljee
in Kourdistan. Hear a place called Ak-boulak, about twenty-five
miles to north-east of Shousha in Transcaucasia, are the ruins of
Kiz Kaleh—Virgin’s castle—situated on a hill in a perfectly impregnable
position. Another Virgin’s castle in that part of Asia, is at
Bakou; an inscription on its walls, in Cufic characters, deciphered
by Khanikoff (<cite>Ysvest. Geog. Obshtchest.</cite>, ix), records its construction
by Masoudi, the son of Daud, one of the “Samiardi fratres”
mentioned in the history of Otto, bishop of Freising. Again,
there is a tower, erected on the highest pinnacle of the rocky
mount upon which stand the fortifications of Soldaya, now
Soudagh, in the Crimea, called Kiz-Koula by the Tatars (<cite>The Crimea
and Transc.</cite>, ii, 158). The ruins of another fortress, Kaleh Dokhter,
are described by Abbott (<cite>Southern Cities of Persia</cite>, MS.) as
crowning the height above the city of Kirman; and visitors to
Constantinople are familiar with the construction on the rock off
Scutari, unaccountably called by Europeans the Tower of Leander,
but known, more legitimately, as the Maiden’s Tower, ever since
it became the burial-place of Damalis, wife of the Athenian general
Chares, who was sent to the assistance of the Byzantines against
Philip of Macedon.</p>

<p>The author says, that on quitting the neighbourhood of the
mysterious castle, he proceeded to Kerasoun; it is, therefore, just
possible that the legend of the sparrow-hawk was attached to an
ancient Kiz-Kalesi seen by Ainsworth (<cite>Travels in Asia Minor</cite>, etc.,
i, 87) near Tash Kupri, close to the road that leads from Kastamuni
to Boiabad, both to the south-west of Sinope. I am unable
to discover why the name was so frequently given in the East,
to such peculiarly situated strongholds, and would suggest that
it was owing to their unassailable position.<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_32" id="Footnote_1_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_32">(1.)</a>  “Lasia.”—The territory of the Lazi was part of Colchis, and
lay between the Phasis and Armenia. The mountainous country
belonged at that time to the empire of Trebizond.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_32" id="Footnote_2_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_32">(2.)</a>  “Kayburt.”—Neumann is persuaded that Schiltberger
alludes to Baïbourt (or Païpourt), a very ancient fortress to the
north-west of Erzeroum, that was restored by Justinian I. Procopius
(<cite>De Bell. Pers.</cite>, iii, 253) calls it Baerberdon. Bishop Aïvazoffsky is
of opinion that “Kayburt” stands for Kaïpourt, called Kharpert by
the natives, situated in a far more fertile country than is Baïbourt.
In Marco Polo’s time, Paipurth was a castle on the road from Trebizond
to Tabrecz; and we learn from Barbaro that the fortress of
Carpurth, distant a five days’ journey from Erzingan, was the
residence of Despina Caton, a princess of Trebizond, the consort of
Hassan Bey.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(2<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) “Kayburt”, in a fertile country, is doubtlessly Kharput,
distant seventy miles, in a direct line, from Erzingan. The Special
Correspondent of <cite>The Times</cite> (January 20th, 1879), has lately described
this place as being situated on the edge of a cliff at the top
of a mountain in a very picturesque situation; but very difficult
to get at, for it takes an hour to ride from the level of the plain to
the town. The plain of Kharput is twenty miles long and twelve
miles wide, presenting 153,600 acres of splendid land, well irrigated,
and in a high state of cultivation.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_32" id="Footnote_3_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_32">(3.)</a>  “Kamach.”—Kemakh is on the site of the ancient city of
Ani, thirty miles from Erzingan and close to the Euphrates, and
not to be confounded with the Ani referred to in Chapter xiii,
note 2. Near Kemakh was the temple of Jupiter, constructed by
Tigranes, and the city afterwards became the principal seat of the
worship of Hormuzd; it was also a state prison, and the burial-place
of the Arsacidæ (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., x, 782–789).
Constantine Porphyrogenitus called this stronghold of the Byzantines,
Κάμαχα. Kemakh was celebrated among the Turks for its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>fine linen, as Erzingan was noted for its good breed of sheep, and
Baïbourt for the beauty of its women. “Kamahoum besy—Erdshenshan
kousy—Baibourdin kysy.”—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_32" id="Footnote_4_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_32">(4.)</a>  “nobody knows where it goes.”—This observation on the
peculiarities of the Upper Euphrates, is confirmed by other authors
(Procopius, <cite>De Bell. Pers.</cite>, i, 17; and Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc.,
x, 736). On emerging from a narrow valley, the river completely
disappears amongst reeds, which, though annually taken and
burnt, again grow very fast, and so thickly, that carts might be
driven over them to cross the river.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(4<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) The recent survey of the Euphrates shows that the river
really disappears in the Lamloun marshes, its width diminishing
to 120 yards towards the town of Lamloun. It again widens at
Karayem, where the Serayah branch on the western side, and
the Nahr Lamloun branch on the eastern side, reunite with the
main stream. Colonel Chesney makes no allusion whatever to an
overgrowth of reeds, and adds (<cite>Exped. to the Euphr. and Tigris</cite>, i,
58, 59): “Being thus reunited to its former waters, and at the same
time free from those marshes in which it had been supposed to be
lost, the Euphrates suddenly reappears on its former scale, enclosed
between high banks covered with jungle.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_32" id="Footnote_5_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_32">(5.)</a>  “Karasser; it is fertile in vineyards.”—Several travellers
and authors, such as Aboulfeda, Tavernier, Otter, Golius, Ritter,
etc., have represented, that the best wines of the country were to
be obtained at Amadia, fifteen miles from Kohrasar—“Karasser”—which
Hammer (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denkschr. d. Kön. Akad. d. Wissensch.</cite>, ix) fancifully
transfers to Kara-hissar in Armenia. Kohrasar is quite uninhabited
and deserted, but the ruins of what were at one time
magnificent churches and other edifices, excited the admiration of
Tavernier (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Six Voy. en Turquie</cite>, etc., en 1642) and Ainsworth
(<cite>Trav. in Asia Minor</cite>, etc., 1842). They indicate the site of the
ancient city of Constantine. It is to be deplored that those
travellers could not afford the time to explore the locality.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_32" id="Footnote_6_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_32">(6.)</a>  “the people are warlike”.—The warlike inhabitants of
Black Turkey were the Turkomans of the White Sheep, who, under
Kara Yelek, their chief, seized upon Amid (Amed, Hamith,
Karamid), the capital of Dyarbekr, in Mesopotamia, after the
death of Timour; it is now known by the same name as the
province, but was called Kara Amid—Amid the black—from the
colour of its walls. Many traces of its grandeur are left. The
academician, Baïer (<cite>De numo Amid.</cite>, 545), shows that it was constructed
by Severus Alexander, and fortified by Justinian.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_7_32" id="Footnote_7_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_32">(7.)</a>  “Bestan.”—This name is probably intended for Bistan, near
the eastern frontier of the pashalik of Soulimanieh. It is now a
village of no importance, but near it are the ruins of an ancient
castle, also the tumuli known as the Roustan tepe and Shah tepe,
in which many objects of antiquity have been found. Judging by
its style of architecture, the castle, constructed of bricks, is believed
to be of the Sassanian period; but it may have been occupied
at a later date, even to the time of Schiltberger, when it was,
perhaps, the capital of Kourdistan. The pasha’s residence at
Soulimanieh is a modern edifice, having been built towards the end
of the 18th century (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., xi, 566).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_8_32" id="Footnote_8_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_32">(8.)</a>  “Zuchtun.”—The noxious nature of the climate on the
eastern sea-board of the Black Sea, has been fully proved by
Russian garrisons to their cost, and especially at “Zuchtun” or
Soukhoum Kaleh. Near this place stood the ancient Dioscurias,
subsequently called Sevastopolis, after an old Roman fortress in
the neighbourhood. It was of great strategic importance to the
Empire in the reign of Justinian (<cite>Novell. constit.</cite>, 28; and Procopius,
<cite>De Bell. Goth.</cite>, iv, 4), and became a prosperous commercial
port after the Black Sea was opened to the Italians. The Genoese
established a consulate at Savastopoli, which was maintained
until the year 1449 (<cite>Zap. Odess. Obstschest.</cite>, v, 809).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(8<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) “Zuchtun”, intended, as shown above, for Soukhoum,
and named Soukhoum Kaleh in the year 1578, when Amurat III.,
as suzerain of Abhase, Mingrelia, Imeritia, and Gouria, arrogated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>to himself the right to fortify and occupy it as one of two points
on the coast (Poti being the other), is the chief town of Abhase,
and distant about sixty miles to the north of Poti. The yearly
mortality, according to late official returns (1874), was reported
as being at the rate of 3 per centum.</p>

<p>The small, square, flat cap seen by Schiltberger, is now in great
measure substituted in Abhase by the g’h’tapt or bashlyk, a
pointed head-covering of great antiquity, adopted in winter by
the troops in Russia, and in fashion among the ladies in that
country; but it is still extensively worn by the Imeritians and
Mingrelians, who call it papanaky, and consider it sufficient
covering for their heads of bushy hair, of which they are very
proud, and which they periodically shave to improve the growth.
The flat cap, or papanaky, is a small lozenge-shaped piece of
leather, cloth, or silk, laid over the fore part of the head, and
fastened with strings under the chin. When worn by nobles, the
papanaky of velvet is made very ornamental, with gold and silver
embroidery. Their Mussulman conquerors used to call the Imeritians,
bashashyk—bare-heads (<cite>The Crimea and Transc.</cite>, i, 120; ii,
35, 135).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_9_32" id="Footnote_9_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_32">(9.)</a>  “Kathon.”—There can be little doubt that Batoum is here
intended, a place which appears as Vati or Lovati, in the charts
of the 14th century.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(9<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) In the present chapter, the capital of Mingrelia is called
“Kathon”; in chapter 67, it is named “Bothan”. Neumann suggests
that for “Kathon” we should read Gori; Professor Bruun is
of opinion that Batoum is intended, and Hammer (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denkschr. d.
Kön. Akad. d. Wissensch.</cite>, ix) thinks that “Kathon” should be
Kargwel or Karduel, and “Bothan”, Cotaïs; but it may fairly
be inferred from Schiltberger’s account, that this “Kathon” or
“Bothan”, as it also appears in the editions of 1475 (?), 1549,
and 1814, stands for Poti. In both chapters, the author speaks
of the chief town of “Megral”, “Magrill”—Mingrelia—as being
situated on the Black Sea, and says that on leaving it, he rode
along the sea-shore until he reached a mountainous country.
Poti, the ancient Phasis, a place of importance from the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>remote times, lays in an unexceptionably flat country, from which
it would have been necessary for Schiltberger, who was effecting
his escape and must therefore have been travelling south, to ride
fully ten miles by the sea-side, before he could have reached a
highland. Gori and Koutaïs, being inland towns, are quite out of
the question, and had the author got to Batoum, he would already
have been in a mountainous country, and need not have described
his ride before attaining it. I cannot find any record that Batoum,
situated in Lazistan, formerly included in Colchis, ever formed
part of the principality of Mingrelia.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_10_32" id="Footnote_10_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_32">(10.)</a>  “Merdin”.—With the exception of the citadel, which remained
in the hands of a prince of the Ortok dynasty, this
place, formerly a chief town of Mesopotamia, had to submit, with
many others, to the yoke of Timour. Upon the death of the conqueror,
his heir, afterwards assassinated by Kara Yelek, called to
his assistance Kara Youssouf, chief of the Turkomans of the Black
Sheep, and gave to him Mardin, in exchange for Mosoul, where
he was poisoned. His son transferred the royal residence to Sindjar,
and died of the plague in the year 814 of the Hegira. These
were the last members of the Ortok dynasty, which reigned
three hundred years.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_33" id="Footnote_1_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_33">(1.)</a>  “Thaures.”—Tabreez, founded by Zobeide the wife of
Haroun-al-Rashid, was long distinguished for the extent of its
commercial relations, in which the Genoese and Venetians took
part. Although frequently pillaged at the hands of enemies,
notably by Janibek in 1357, and by Toktamish in 1387, Tabreez
soon recovered from its misfortunes. This capital even became
the principal depôt for merchandise from India and China,
after the destruction of the cities of Ourjenj and Astrahan by
Timour, who established a commodious route between Tabreez
and Samarkand by way of Kashin and Soultanyà. Schiltberger’s
statement as to the custom’s revenue at Tabreez, will not seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>exaggerated in presence of the fact, that in 1460 it amounted to
60,000 ducats. Ramusio observes that Tabreez, the great depôt,
rivalled Paris in its magnificence, and in the number of its inhabitants.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Writing in 1868, Abbott (<cite>Persian Azerbaijan</cite>, MS.) says
that Tabreez was the principal seat of commerce in all Persia, and
the mart from which nearly all the northern and midland countries
were supplied with the produce and manufactures of Europe,
conveyed to it chiefly by land transport from the Black Sea; the
yearly value was estimated at £1,750,000, the value of goods imported
from England being probably three-fourths of that sum.
The city contained about 3100 shops of all descriptions; thirty
karavansaraïs, occupied by merchants and traders; and about
forty others devoted to the accommodation of muleteers and their
cattle. Abbott adds, that the commerce of Tabreez had made
great advances since 1830, having increased eight-fold in 1860.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_33" id="Footnote_2_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_33">(2.)</a>  “Rei.”—After passing Teheran, upon the occasion of his
journey from Soultanyà to Samarkand, Clavijo perceived, at a distance
of two leagues, a great city in ruins ... “but there appeared
towers and mosques, and the name of the place was Xahariprey”—Shehri-Rei,
the city of Rei, “at one time the largest city in all
the land”, says Khanikoff, “though it is now uninhabited”. But
Rey did not remain long thus unpeopled, because the Russian
merchant Nikitin (who visited India thirty years before Vasco de
Gama), though leaving Teheran unnoticed, as does Schiltberger,
speaks of his stay at Rey, where he witnessed the celebration of
the famous Persian festival, instituted in commemoration of the
death of Hussein, the son of Ali and grandson of the prophet.
(<cite>Poln. Sobr.</cite>, etc., vi, 332.)—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(2<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) To the above might be added the evidence of Ibn Haukal,
that there was not in the eastern regions any city more flourishing.
Rey was celebrated for its gates, for its many remarkable quarters
and streets, its numerous bazaars, karavansaraïs, and market-places.
The fine linen, camelot, and cotton manufactured at Rey,
was sent to all parts of the world. Late travellers have found its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>site marked by hollows and mounds; mouldering towers, tombs,
and wells, constructed of burnt and sun-dried materials (Ker
Porter, <cite>Travels in Georgia, Persia</cite>, etc., 1822; Mounsey, <cite>Journey
through the Caucasus</cite>, etc., 1872). In the 3rd century of Mahomedanism,
Rey was specially noted for its wealth, and was styled,
The First of Cities—The Spouse of the World—The Market of the
Universe. (Chardin, <cite>Langlès edition</cite>, ii, 411.)—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_33" id="Footnote_3_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_33">(3.)</a>  “Raphak.”—If Schiltberger’s companions, when on his
journey to Rey or Rhe, were Sunnites, they probably looked upon
the people of that city as apostates from the faith; for “Raphak”,
therefore, we should read Raphadzhy—abjurer—a term applied to
renegades. These disciples admit themselves to be Shey—partisans—whence
the term Shyites, and in the present instance they
were evidently called by the opprobrious name of Raphadzy, as
being apostates, by those of a different sect. Ibn Batouta met at
Kotaïf (Katiff of Benjamin of Tudela), on the Persian Gulf, some
Arabs of the Rafiza sect, who were most enthusiastic, publishing
their sentiments everywhere, and fearing no one.</p>

<p>There are Shyite Tatars in Transcaucasia, chiefly in the valley
of the Araxes, also in the richly cultivated province of Ouroumyeh,
the seat of the Christian Nestorians, where they people eight
villages. These Shyites call themselves Ali Allahy—Worshippers
of Ali—and are not averse to drinking wine.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_33" id="Footnote_4_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_33">(4.)</a>  “Nachson.”—Clavijo (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>, 80) sojourned for
a time in a city which he calls Calmarin, and attributes its foundation
to a son of Noah. This place was probably Sourmalou
on the Araxes, taken by Timour in 1385. Tutan, the Turkoman
who resided here, might have been the “Tetani, Emperor of
Tartary”, who, according to Clavijo, had conquered the place,
though only a viceroy. There was a Titanus, Vicarius Canlucorum,
of the Genoese, in 1449; the Tautaun, Taudoun, of the
Avares and Khozars. Two days before reaching Calmarin, Clavijo
passed the night in a town called Naujua, where there were many
Armenians, which must have been the “Nachson” of Schiltberger,
now known as Nahitchevan.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_33" id="Footnote_5_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_33">(5.)</a>  “Maragara.”—There are numerous remains of ancient
fortifications on the heights around Meragha. In a westerly
direction, at a distance of thirteen miles to the south-west of
Tabreez, are the foundations of a round tower, believed to have
been the celebrated observatory of Khodja Nazr uddin—defensor
fidei—the friend of Houlakon, who transferred his residence to
Meragha after the capture of Baghdad in 1258. To this day is
shown his tomb,<a name="FNanchor_5_33a" id="FNanchor_5_33a"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_33a" class="fnanchor">1</a> and that of his wife Dogous or Dokouz Khatoun,
the protectress of Christians, but especially of Nestorians, in
whose doctrines she had great faith (Hammer, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Ilchane</cite>,
etc., i, 82). Shortly after her death, the patriarch, Iabellasa, agreed
to recognise the supremacy of the Pope, the act having been presented
to Benedict II. by a Dominican friar named Jacob. Mosheim
(<cite>Hist. Tartarorum Eccles.</cite>, 92) pronounces against the authenticity
of this document, an opinion shared by Heyd (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
Colon. der Römisch. Kirche</cite>, etc., 322), on the grounds that it was
signed at Meragha. It may, however, be contended that the
patriarch might have resided for a time at Meragha, after the fall
of Baghdad to the Mongols, considering that his successors had no
fixed residence to 1559, in which year the patriarch Elias definitively
established the seat at Mosoul; and that a tradition is preserved
amongst the Nestorians or Chaldæans of Kourdistan, to the
effect that their ancestors, who had resisted Timour, were domiciled
between the lakes Van and Ouroumyeh.</p>

<p>In the early part of the 14th century, another brother preacher,
Jordanus Catalani, recorded in his <cite>Mirabilia</cite> (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>,
9), that those schismatics had adopted the Catholic faith in
several cities of Persia, to wit, at Tabreez, Soultanyà, and at
“Ur of the Chaldees, where Abraham was born, which is a very
opulent city, distant about two days from Tabriz”. Heyd says
that this Ur cannot be Orfa, a town in central Mesopotamia,
which has been identified with the Ur-Khasdim of the Arabians
(Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., x, 333); but is more probably the
ancient city of Maranda, not far from the lake Ouroumyeh
and fifty miles only from Tabreez. But Meragha was, in like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>manner, at no great distance from the said lake, and only twenty-four
miles, or, according to Hadjy Khalpha, seven farsangs from
Tabreez; we are, therefore, justified in concluding, that it was
this place the friar designated as Ur of the Chaldees, especially as
it was a large city and a bishop’s see in 1320 (Galanus, <cite>Concil.
Eccl. Arm. cum Rom.</cite>, i, 508; quoted by Heyd, 324). The same
cannot be said of Maranda.</p>

<p>Bartholomew of Bologna has given evidence of his zeal, in the
fact that many of the Armenian clergy went over to the Church
of Rome, and with the view of cementing this union, a new Order,
“Fratres prædicatores Uniti”, was founded and affiliated to the
Dominicans, whose head-centre was at Meragha. But the theory
propounded by Bishop Aïvazoffsky is worthy of consideration,
viz., that Ur is no other than Urmi or Ormi, a town of some size,
hitherto largely inhabited by Nestorian Chaldæans, and that has
given its name to the lake Ourmiah, Ormi, or Ouroumyeh. It is
believed to be the birth-place of Zoroaster, who might have been
mistaken for Abraham as easily as he has been for Moses.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

after a three days’ siege. Aboulfeda quotes Abou Said,
who says that it rivalled Damascus. Bakui (<cite>Not. et Extr.</cite>, ii, 513)
extols Khelat for its good water, fruit, and the fish taken from the
lake, especially the tamrin, possibly the dorakine found in the
Kour, as related by Ystachry (<cite>Mordtmann edition</cite>, 1845). The
numerous ruins in the neighbourhood are of the time when Akhlat
was the residence of the Shahy Armen—kings of Armenia; they
include those of a superb palace, of gorgeous tombs, artificial
grottoes, and of a fortress on the shore of Lake Van. Khelat
is now a miserable hamlet occupied by Kurds.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(6<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Khelat, Ghelath, Ashlath, was long the residence of a

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_7_33" id="Footnote_7_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_33">(7.)</a>  “Kirna.”—On the Gharny-tchaï, a tributary of the Zenga,
east of Erivan, is Gharny or Bash Gharny, now an insignificant
village, but at one time a place of considerable importance. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>to the old Armenian chroniclers, Kharny was founded 2000
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> by a prince Keghamè, who named it after himself; but the
name was afterwards changed by Kharnig, the grandson of Keghamè,
to Kharny. It was here that Tiridates, 286–314, constructed
for his favourite sister a superb residence, to which Moses Chorensis
(<cite>Whiston edition</cite>, 1736), the Armenian chronicler of the 5th century,
thus refers: “Per id tempus Tiridates castelli Garnii
ædificationem absolvit, quod quadratis et cæsis lapidibus, ferro et
plumbo coagmentatis construxit, atque ibi umbraculum statuit et
monumentum mirifica arte cælatum, pro sorore sua Chosroiduchta,
in eoque memoriam sui græcis literis inscripsit.” This remarkable
edifice is alluded to by Kiracos of Gantzac, also an Armenian
chronicler, of the 13th century, as “the marvellous throne of
Tiridates”, in front of the cemetery of Kharny (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. d’Arménie</cite>
trans. by M. Brosset, St. Petersburg, 1870). It is now a heap of
ruins, known to the natives as Takht Dertad—Throne of Tiridates.</p>

<p>At a short distance above Gharny, also on the Gharny-tchaï in
the Goktcha valley, is the venerable monastery of Aïrits vank,
Ghergarr or Keghart, noted for its memorial inscriptions of the
12th, 13th, and 14th centuries (<cite>The Crimea and Transc.</cite>, i, 211,

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_8_33" id="Footnote_8_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_33">(8.)</a>  “the priests are of the Order of Preachers, and sing in the
Armenian tongue.”—What Schiltberger says with regard to “Meya”—Magou—is
confirmed by Clavijo (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>, 83). “On
Sunday, the first of June, at the hour of vespers, they came to a
castle called Maca, belonging to a Catholic Christian called Noradin,
and the people who lived in it were Catholic Christians, though they
were by birth and language Armenians, and they also knew the
Tartar and Persian tongues. In this place there was a monastery
of Dominican friars. The castle was in a valley, at the foot of
a very high rock, and there was a village on a hill above, and on
the top of the hill there was a wall of stone and mortar, with
towers, and against the wall there were houses. There was also
another wall with towers, and the entrance to it was by a great
tower, built to guard it, along steps cut in the rocks. Near the
second wall there were houses cut in the rock, and in the centre
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>were some towers and houses, where the lord lived, and here all
the people in the village kept their provisions. The rock was very
high, and rose above the walls and houses; and from the rocks
an overhanging part stretched out, which covers the castle, walls,
and houses, like the heaven that is above them.”—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(8<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Tradition asserts that Makou, Makouyeh, in the Armenian
province of Artazo-Tasht, to the east of Ararat and south of the
Araxes, is built over the place where St. Thaddeus suffered martyrdom.
The fortress is situated in a gorge above the village (J.

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_9_33" id="Footnote_9_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_33">(9.)</a>  “Ress.”—Resht, the chief town of Ghilan, a place of great
commercial importance in Schiltberger’s time, is distant six miles
from the Caspian Sea. The Genoese and Venetians secured the
rich produce of this province, especially the silken stuffs made
there or imported from Yezd and Kashan. Marco Polo (Yule, i,
54) speaks of silk called Ghellè, after the name of the country on
the Sea of Ghel or Ghelan—the Caspian.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_10_33" id="Footnote_10_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_33">(10.)</a>  “Strawba.”—Schiltberger changes Astrabad to “Strawba”,
just as his Italian contemporaries have called the place Strava,
Strevi, and Istarba. Its commerce was not considerable, but Astrabad
was of some importance as being the depôt for merchandise in
transit across the Caspian, from India and Bokhara.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_11_33" id="Footnote_11_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_33">(11.)</a>  “Antioch.”—Several cities of Asia were in ancient times
called Antiochia. Stephen of Byzantium knew of eight, two of
which, Edessa and Nisibis, were in Migdonia; and as each, in its
turn, had become the foremost bulwark of Christianity, their possession
was frequently disputed by the Infidels. Allusion is made
in the text to Nisibis, with its ramparts of brick, rather than to
Edessa, which was encircled by whitewashed walls.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_12_33" id="Footnote_12_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_33">(12.)</a>  “Aluitza.”—If the author here alludes to the same fortress
(Alindsha ?) as is mentioned in chapter 16, of which there can
scarcely be a doubt, that is to say, the fortress in which Ahmed
ben Oweis kept his treasure; then the story of its siege by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>Timour for the space of sixteen years, was a gross exaggeration on
the part of his informants, because we know from contemporary
authors that the siege of Alindsha lasted eight years only.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_13_33" id="Footnote_13_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_33">(13.)</a>  “There is a city called Scheckhy; it is in a fertile country
near the White Sea.”—It will be generally admitted that this
White Sea is no other than the Caspian. Hammer (note, p. 45)
says it was so called to distinguish it from the Black Sea; but
Wahl (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allg. Beschr. d. persischen Reichs</cite>, ii, 679) attributes the distinctive
name to the petrified shells, white and gray sand, with
which the bed of the sea is overspread. It is pretty certain that
White Sea is not a name invented by the author, but that he supplies
us with the literal translation of the Georgian words—Tetrysea
and Sywa, which have a similar signification, and are even now employed
to designate the Caspian Sea. Hammer is mistaken in saying
that Schiltberger called the eastern shore of the Caspian by the
name of Scherky, as the word appears in Penzel, and which is
simply a corruption of “Scheckhy”, now known as Sheky, on the
left bank of the river Kour, between Georgia, the districts of
Gandja, Shirwan and Daghestan. It is said that this part of the
country was occupied as early as the 10th century by the Shekis
or Shekines, a Christian people given to commerce and industrial
pursuits (D’Ohsson, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Peup. du Cauc.</cite> 18, and note xiv).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_14_33" id="Footnote_14_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_33">(14.)</a>  “the kingdom Horoson, and its capital is called Hore.”—As
stated by Neumann, these places are intended for Khorasan
and Herat. According to Masoudi (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc.,
x. 65), there existed at the time of the conquest of Hira near the
Euphrates, <i>circa</i> <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 637, the negotiator Abd-el-Mesy, a man
greatly revered by the Arabs in consequence of his wisdom and
great age. He had attained his 350th year, and enjoyed the distinction
of being considered, if not a saint, at least a servant of
God, that is to say, an Ibadite or Jacobite Christian.</p>

<p>Ibn Haukal states that the city of Hira, which was still in
existence in the time of Edrisi (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil des Voy. et des Mém.</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>iii, 366), was distant one farsang from Koufa, which with Basra
was called Basraten—dualis of Basra—or the two Basras, the metropolis
of the Nestorians at Basra being known as Euphrates
Pherat Mesene or Perat Meissan, a name it had borne since <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
310. We are informed by Eastern writers, that at Konfa was the
tomb of the saint, Adam (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., x, 179–184), a
name that reminds us of “Phiradamschyech”, whose age coincided
with that of Abd-el-Mesy.</p>

<p>Schiltberger may perhaps have applied to Herat, which he
visited, the legend of Hira, a Shyite place of pilgrimage.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_15_33" id="Footnote_15_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_33">(15.)</a>  “Phiradamschyech.”—This is one of the few names in
Schiltberger’s narrative that appears somewhat difficult to determine.
Pir, in Persian, signifies an old, a venerable man; also,
a chief. Sheykh has a similar meaning in Arabic. Adam is
the Persian, Turkish, and Arabic for man; so that “Phiradamschyech”
consists of three substantives, and being interpreted,
reads thus: A chief—a man—a chief.</p>

<p>A very similar story is related by Ibn Batouta, Schiltberger’s
predecessor by about fifty years. After passing the Hindu Kush,
he got to a mountain called Bashai where he saw in a cell an old
man named Ata Evlia—Father of the Saints—said to be 350 years
old, but who appeared to be about fifty. Every hundred years
he had a new growth of teeth and hair. There is no doubt
whatever of Ibn Batouta’s own incredulity as to the reputed
history of this man, to whom he put several questions, which,
being unsatisfactorily answered, caused him to apprehend that
there was no truth in the wonderful statements made about him.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_16_33" id="Footnote_16_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_33">(16.)</a>  “Schiras.”—“Kerman.”—Sheeraz, the birth place of
Saadi and Hafiz, two of the most celebrated and popular poets of
Persia, was so called, says a rare Persian manuscript, after a
word in the old Persick language signifying—Lion’s paunch—because
all the wealth of every town in the same region was
transported thither not to return elsewhere (Ouseley, <cite>Travels</cite>, etc.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>ii, 23). Edrisi’s definition (<cite>Jaubert edition</cite>, 392) is somewhat
clearer, for he says that the name was given because the place
consumed without producing anything. This city is said to have
been founded in the earliest years of Islam; the walls, which
measured 12,500 paces in circumference, being constructed in the
10th century. Kazvini (quoted by Ouseley) observed nine gates,
and in 1811 Ouseley saw six only. Ibn Haukal (<cite>Ouseley edition</cite>,
101) wrote of Sheeraz as being a modern city.</p>

<p>In 1627, Sir Thomas Herbert (<cite>Travels into Divers Parts</cite>, etc.,
127) found some of the old walls of “the pleasantest of Asiatick
cities” still standing, but in Chardin’s time (<cite>Langlès edition</cite>,
viii, 414) they had disappeared. The present fortifications,
erected by Kerim Khan in the middle of the 18th century,
were ruined by Aga Mohammed Shah after the struggle between
the Zund and Kujjar families. They are of the extent of about
three and a half miles, and were originally of such massive construction,
that it was said three horsemen might have ridden
abreast on them. The population in 1850 was estimated at
35,000 to 40,000; but the general want of employment begat
amongst the people that disposition for mischief, brawls and
insurrections, for which the place was remarkable beyond any
other town in Persia (Abbott, <cite>Southern Cities of Persia</cite>, MS.).</p>

<p>Kirman, also visited by Abbott, is encircled by walls of two and
a half miles to three miles in circumference, and had a population
(1850) not exceeding 25,000. The appearance of this town and
the scenery around, are extremely unpromising and dreary, from
the scarcity of trees, the little cultivation, and the few villages
about. A vastly different condition to the “good country” noted
by Schiltberger, and the statement of Marco Polo (Yule, i, 92),
that on quitting the city of Kerman “you ride on for seven days,
always finding towns, villages, and handsome dwelling-houses, so
that it is very pleasant travelling”.</p>

<p>Abbott says further, that Kirman was not of much commercial
importance, being so far removed from the direct lines of communication
between other chief places, and being adjacent to vast
and unproductive regions.</p>

<p>It is by no means clear that Schiltberger was ever at Kirman;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>but if his account of that town and of the islands in the Persian
Gulf is given from personal observation, which is very doubtful,
it is possible that he followed the same route as traced by Colonel
Yule in Marco Polo’s <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Itineraries</cite>, No. ii.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_17_33" id="Footnote_17_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_33">(17.)</a>  “Keschon”, “Hognus”, “Kaff”.—Kishm, Hormuz, and
Kais, are three islands in the Persian Gulf, which, however,
Schiltberger does not particularise as such. Kishm, the largest
of the three, is called by the Persians, Draz Jazyra—Long Island—the
more familiar name being Harkh. An excellent harbour
is formed on the south side by the island of Angar. Kishm
was occupied in 1622 by an English force, which destroyed a fort
the Portuguese had erected the previous year, one of the few
Englishmen killed upon the occasion being William Baffin who
in 1616 sailed round Baffin’s Bay.</p>

<p>Colonel Yule (Marco Polo, i, 113) has clearly established the
site of ancient Hormuz on the main land, a city that was abandoned
for the island of Zarun, afterwards Hormuz, in 1315
(Ouseley, <cite>Travels</cite>, etc., i, 157), as a protection, says Aboulfeda,
from the repeated incursions of the Tatars. Already, in the days
of Ibn Batouta, who mentions both Old and New Hormuz (<cite>Lee
edition</cite>, 63), was Harauna, the new city and residence of the
king, a large and beautiful place; and Friar Oderic, his contemporary,
remarks on the efficient fortifications of Ormes, and its
great store of merchandise and treasure; so that its reputation as
a great commercial depôt was well established in Schiltberger’s
time. Of the many travellers who have described the island,
Varthema, 1503–1508 (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>, 94), reported, that as
many as three hundred vessels belonging to different countries
were sometimes assembled at the noble city of Ormus, which was
extremely beautiful; and some years later, 1563, Cesare Federici
(Hakluyt <cite>Voyages</cite>, ii, 342) noticed a great trade there in all
sorts of spice, drugs, silk, cloth of silk, brocardo, and other merchandise.
Hormuz, like Kishm, was also recovered from the
Portuguese by the English for Shah Abbas in 1623, until which
period it was a stately and rich place, of which the inhabitants
made the boast that “if the world were a ring, Ormus must be
considered as the diamond”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>The city has now completely disappeared, and over the space
of about one square mile of its site may be seen, here and there,
the foundations of houses, those near the sea being the most
visible. In the neighbourhood are several hundred reservoirs,
and many Mussulman tombs, some of which are enclosed within
domed buildings that had some pretensions to architecture (<cite>Persian
Gulf Pilot</cite>, 1870, 148).</p>

<p>Kais is mentioned by many authors as being a place of considerable
importance. It was the ancient Καταία (<cite>Nearchi Paraplus
ex Arriano</cite>, 31; <cite>Hudson edition</cite>, i), is called Keis by the Arabs, is
named Ken by Kinnear (<cite>Memoirs of the Persian Empire</cite>, 17), and
appears in the Admiralty chart as Kais or Gais, inhabited by pearl
fishers. Yagout (Barbier de Meynard, <cite>Dict. Géog.</cite>, etc., 499) in the
13th century says of Kisch, that it was the residence of the
sovereigns of Oman, whose authority extended over all the sea, on
which they were very powerful; it was the place of call for vessels
trading between Fars and India, and a celebrated pearl fishery.
Kazvini (<cite>Kosmographie</cite>, 235) speaks of Kis as the resort of
merchants who went there to trade; and Benjamin of Tudela, a
century earlier, describes it as being a port of transit.</p>

<p>The ancient town of Harira is now represented by tottering
masses of masonry; a portion of a minaret of well cut stone, and
many fallen pillars of the mosque to which the minaret belonged,
being the only architectural remains. Great quantities of broken
pottery, some of fine quality, lie scattered among the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</em>. At
a distance of a quarter of a mile are large reservoirs for water, all
faced with masonry, but in a sad state of decay; some measure
120 ft. in length, by 24 ft., and are 24 ft. in depth.</p>

<p>Admitting the authority of a Persian manuscript, says Ouseley
(<i>l. c.</i>, i, 170), the name of the island may be assigned to the 10th
century, when one Keis, the son of a poor widow in Siraf, embarked
for India with his sole property, a cat. There he arrived
at a fortunate time, for the king’s palace was infested with mice.
Keis produced his cat, the noxious animals disappeared, and the
adventurer of Siraf was magnificently rewarded. He returned to
his home, but afterwards settled with his mother and brothers on
the island, which was named Keis, or, according to the Persians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>Keish. Modern attempts to rationalise Whittington may surely
be given up, observes Colonel Yule with reference to this story
related by Wassaf.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_18_33" id="Footnote_18_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_33">(18.)</a>  “Walaschoen.”—This name, employed also by Orientals,
is now Badakshan, called Badashan by Marco Polo, who says that
rubies were found in the province. Ibn Haukal was also aware
that Badakshan yielded rubies and lapis-lazuli, and Ibn Batouta
asserts that the rubies (balas rubies) from the mountains of
Badakshan were commonly called Ak Balaksh. A river flowed
from these mountains, the water of which was as white as that of
the sea. He adds that Jengiz, king of the Tatars, ruined the
country, so that it never flourished afterwards. Judging, however,
from Schiltberger’s account, it is probable that its condition
had improved.</p>

<p>The unicorns may have been horses of a good breed, as alluded
to by Marco Polo (Yule, i, 166), who states that, “not long ago
they possessed in that province a breed of horses from the strain
of Alexander’s horse, Bucephalus, all of which had from their
birth a particular mark on the forehead”. If we consider that in
the time of Timour, the nationality of the inhabitants, the military
administration, and the breed of horses in this country, were the
same as in the days of Kublai, the ruler had, no doubt, ever
been a “None”, Nono, which Marco Polo (<i>idem</i>, i, 183) gives as
the equivalent for Count. Whatever the origin and primitive
significations of this term, I may, perhaps, not be far out in
asserting, that in the present instance it designated a noyon or
myriarch, such as was Jebe, the vanquisher of the Russians at the
battle of the Kalka in 1223 (Berezin, <cite>Nashestvye Mongolov</cite>, 226),
and Noë, Duke of Sousdal, who, at about the same period, gave to
Julian the missionary, letters of recommendation to Bela IV., King
of Hungary (Kunik, <cite>Outch. Zap.</cite>, etc., iii, 739), and Tolak Timour
the cruel governor of Soudak (<cite>Zap. Odess. Obstschest.</cite>, v, 507).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(18<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) When Captain Wood was in Badakshan, he was told
that the valley of Meshid was extremely populous in former
times, and a legend was current to the effect that it used to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>greatly infested with scorpions (<cite>Journey to the Source of the River
Oxus</cite>, 1872). Colonel Yule thinks, that if the existence of unicorns
was not a mere fable, the animal referred to was probably
the rhinoceros, at that time common in the country near Peshawur—not
very far from Badakshan.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_34" id="Footnote_1_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_34">(1.)</a>  “Marburtirudt.”—These measurements agree so exactly
with the dimensions to be found in Herodotus, who gives the
height of the walls of Babylon at 200 cubits and their thickness
at 50 cubits, that the extent of the city, 480 stadia, was probably
obtained from the same source. But four stadia do not
make one Italian mile. The Italian mile is equal to eight stadia,
480 stadia are, therefore, 60 Italian, or 55-1/5 English miles, no
great difference from the 75 miles or 25 leagues noted in the
text as being the extent of the wall of Babylon.</p>

<p>The Tower of Babel, represented as being 54 stadia from the
city, must have been distant 6.75 Italian, or 6.21 English miles,
precisely the position of Birs Nimroud—Prison of Nimrod—called
“Marburtirudt”, for Marbout Nimroud. It was to these ruins
that Benjamin of Tudela (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., x, 263) referred
when describing the tower constructed before the dispersion
of the people, situated on the right bank of the Euphrates, and
one and a half hour’s journey from Hillah; it measured 240 yards
in diameter, and was about 100 canna in height; a gallery conducted
to the summit, whence the view around extended over the
plain to a distance of eight leagues. Schiltberger expresses himself
to the same effect when he says, “in several places it is x leagues
in length and in breadth”. In adding that the tower stood on the
Chaldæan side of the Arabian desert, he has no intention of directing
us to Arabia proper, but to Irak Araby, the country of the
ancient Chaldæans.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_34" id="Footnote_2_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_34">(2.)</a>  “And one inch is the first member of the thumb.”—Schiltberger
fails to distinguish the Italian from the Lombard mile; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>are therefore at liberty to conclude that he here alludes to the
ancient Roman mile, .75 of a degree, which consists of 59,800
untz or zoll, the zoll being equal to the English inch. In saying that
the Italian or Lombard mile consists of 45,000 inches only, Schiltberger
gives us to understand that the “schuch” was one-fourth
shorter than the foot; in other words, he refers to the palma, an
Italian measure of his day. It follows, therefore, that the pace of
five palmas must have measured 3 ft. 9 in.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_34" id="Footnote_3_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_34">(3.)</a>  “Schatt.”—The Tigris is still known as the Schat (Ritter,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., xi, 4), not only from its junction with the
Euphrates, but also along the whole of its upper course (Rachid-Eddin
by Quatremère, xxix), which justified Barbaro in having said
that Hassanchiph was near the Set.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(3<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) This is confirmed by Colonel Chesney (<cite>Exped. to the
Euphr. and Tigris</cite>, i, 60), who writes that Shatt, or more correctly
Shatt-el-Arab, is the name given to the rivers Euphrates and
Tigris after their junction at the walled town of Kournah; but
that the designation belongs properly to the Tigris. This river is
clearly called Schot by Olearius.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_34" id="Footnote_4_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_34">(4.)</a>  “Kinna.”—This fruit, called “kurnia” in Penzel’s edition,
is probably the khourmà, date-plum—Diospyros lotus—an ebanaceous
tree growing plentifully in Persia and Transcaucasia, and
perhaps the kheilan of Ibn Batouta. The berry is largely imported
into Russia, and a favourite spirit distilled from it. It
is totally distinct from the date-palm—Phœnix dactylifera—called
in the East, taltal. Marco Polo (Yule, i, 110) speaks of a very
good wine made from dates, mixed with spices.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_34" id="Footnote_5_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_34">(5.)</a>  “In this kingdom the people are not warlike.”—It is not
surprising that Schiltberger should have been struck by the
pacific disposition of the people of Baghdad, a city that owed its
opulence to industry and commerce. Baghdad was reconstructed
by Ahmen ben Oweis after its destruction by Timour (Weil,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 98). The inhabitants were Arabs and
Persians, as they are now. That a large park and menagerie
should have existed is in the highest degree probable, for we read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>in Zosimus (<cite>Hist. Rom.</cite>, iii, 23), that the troops of the emperor
Julian discovered a royal garden in Mesopotamia, in which
wild beasts were kept: εἰς περίβολον ὃν Βασιλέως θήραν ἐκάλον.
The Greeks of Heraclius’s expedition, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 627, found a large park
close to the residence of Chosroes (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite> etc., ix,
503), in which were many ostriches, wild boar, peacocks, pheasants,
lions, tigers, etc. Another instance was the residence, near
Baghdad, of the caliph El-Harim, which stood within grounds
wherein were wild beasts of every description (<i>ibid.</i>, x, 258).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_34" id="Footnote_6_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_34">(6.)</a>  “It has long fore-legs, and the hinder are short.”—Soon
after the battle of Angora, the sultan Faradj sent two ambassadors
with rich presents to Timour, one being a giraffe (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch.
der Chal.</cite>, v, 97), which Clavijo, who met the Egyptian envoys
at Khoi, designated a gornufa. Schiltberger must have originally
written surnofa, rather than “surnasa”. The giraffe he saw in
Timour’s possession was probably one of the finest of its species,
so that allowance should be made for his ascribing to its neck a
length of four fathoms; indeed, we learn from Clavijo that this
very animal was able to extend its neck so as to reach herbage at
a height of 30 feet to 36 feet.</p>

<p>Schiltberger was under the impression, as was his contemporary
De Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 88), that the Nile traversed
India before entering Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_6_34a" id="FNanchor_6_34a"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_34a" class="fnanchor">1</a> which accounts for his supposition
that the giraffe was indigenous to the former country.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_34a" id="Footnote_6_34a"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_34a"><span class="label">1</span></a>That Ethiopia was called India, and thus confounded with real
India, is fully set forth by Colonel Yule in a note to Marco Polo, ii, 426.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>(6<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Zerypha—yellow-coloured—is the Persian for giraffe,
from zerd—yellow—and fam—colour; a name corrupted by the
Turks and Arabs to zerafè, whence “surnasa”. The giraffe at the
British Museum could have reached food at a height of at least
twenty feet, as Dr. Günther, Keeper of Zoology, has been good
enough to inform me. The finest specimen at the Museum d’Histoire
Naturelle, at Paris, is even inferior in size, according to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>measurements kindly supplied by Professor Milne-Edward of that
institution. Schiltberger must have greatly miscalculated the
proportions of the animal he saw, allowing even for probable degeneration;
large giraffes having now become very scarce.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_7_34" id="Footnote_7_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_34">(7.)</a>  “Zekatay.”—Jagatai owes its name to the second son of
Jengiz Khan, who received in appanage the countries to the east
and south-east of the Oulons of Jujy, that is to say, from the
limits of Khorasan (until taken from the Jujy by Timour) on both
sides of the Amu-Darya, to Turkestan. All those territories were
included under the name of Jagatai, as were also the dialects of
the inhabitants. The last princes of the house, and in whose name
Timour ruled, were Suurgatmysh and Mahmoud; their coinage
was struck at Bokhara, Samarkand, Termed, Kesh, Badakshan,
and Otrar; but their residence was at Besh balyk—Five Cities—until
transferred by Timour to Samarkand, which the despot
sought to place at the head of all cities in Asia, by means of
the vigorous measures to which Clavijo bears witness.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_35" id="Footnote_1_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_35">(1.)</a>  “Great Tartaria.”—The details entered into by Schiltberger
in this chapter, demonstrate that he includes in Great
Tatary the possessions of the three branches of the Jujy. First,
the Ordou Itchen or the White Horde, who were the successors of
the eldest son of Jujy. Secondly, those of the Golden Horde, the
successors of Batou, the second son; and, Thirdly, those of
Shaïban, the fifth son, who, in recompense for his brilliant services
during Batou’s campaign in Russia, received from the Ordou Itchen
some territories near the Ural for his summer encampment; and
for his winter use, those near the Syr Darya, that is to say, the
actual steppe of the Kirghis, so that the domains of the Shaïbani
separated the Golden Horde from the White Horde. Their
dominions afterwards extended northwards, when they nominated
khans to Siberia.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) “Tartaria” and “Tartaren”, as the names are spelled
throughout the text, are substituted in these Notes by Tatary
and Tatars, it is hoped on fair grounds. Professor Nève asserts
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exposé des Guerres de Tamerlan</cite>, etc.: <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’après la Chronique
Arménienne inédite de</cite> Thomas de Medzoph, 24) that Tatar is the
term employed by Armenian chroniclers, and he names no exceptions;
and is not her ancient literature one of the several excellencies
of which Armenia may be justly proud? A note by Dr.
Smith in Gibbon (<cite>Rise and Fall</cite>, etc., iii, 294) shows how the
Tatars became accidentally named Tartars, through an exclamation
of St. Louis of France, although it must be admitted that
according to other authors, the use of the word Tartar, in Western
Europe, is of earlier date; and Genebrard states (<cite>Lib. Heb. Chro.
Bib.</cite>, i, 158) that Tatar, which in the Hebrew and Syriac signifies
abandoned, deserted, should more correctly be written without an
r. The Russians, whose pronunciation of these words is, for
obvious reasons, entitled to every consideration, speak of
Tatáry’ya-Tatary—and Tatáry—Tatars—unquestionably the
sound uttered by the various people themselves, claiming the distinctive
appellation, whether on the banks of the Volga, in South
Russia, the Crimea, or in the steppes and lowlands of Transcaucasia,
as the writer of this note is prepared to testify. The Russian
word Tatarui, or Tatars, says Ralston (<cite>Early Russian History</cite>,
198, wherein is cited F. Porter Smith’s <cite>Vocab.</cite>, etc., 52), modified
in Western Europe by a reference to Tartarus into Tartars, is now
generally applied by Russian writers to what used to be the
Turkish subjects of the Mongol Empire. It is said to be a corruption
of Tah-tan, the name under which the Mongols were
anciently known to the Chinese. Morrison writes Tătă as
Chinese for Tartars.</p>

<p>Colonel Yule (Marco Polo, i, 12) calls attention to an article in
the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal Asiatique</cite>, ser. v, tom. xi, 203, to show that the
name Tartar is of Armenian rather than of European origin, whilst
admitting that Tatar was used by Oriental writers of Polo’s age,
exactly as Tartar was then, and is still, used in Western Europe
as a generic title for the Turanian hosts who followed Chingis and
his successors; but he believes that the name in this sense was
not known in Western Europe before the time of Chingis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>In Howorth’s <cite>History of the Mongols</cite>, 1877 (the one volume as
yet published), a ponderous book of 743 pages, replete with the
most erudite information, but unhappily unprovided with any
guide to its contents, will be found at page 700, a long note, in
which admission is made that the word Tartar has given rise to
much discussion; and whilst the Russian and Byzantine authors,
the Bohemian chronicler Dalemil, Ivo of Narbonne, and Thomas
of Spalatro, are cited in favour of the use of Tatar, other
authorities are quoted to establish a respectable pedigree for
Tartar.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_35" id="Footnote_2_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_35">(2.)</a>  “Seat him on white felt, and raise him in it three times.”—The
raising to the White Felt is similarly described by Giovanni
dal Piano di Carpine (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil de Voy. et de Mém.</cite>, etc.). Vambery
(<cite>Trav. in Central Asia</cite>, 356) says that the being raised to the
White Felt is still the exclusive privilege of the gray-beards of the
tribe of Jagatai, and that the custom is kept up at the investiture
of the khans of Khokand.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_36" id="Footnote_1_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_36">(1.)</a>  “Edil, which is a great river.”—The large river here
called “Edil”, the Turkish for river, could have been no other
than the Oxus or Amu-Darya. Orden cannot in any manner be
identified with “Origens”, mentioned in chapter 25, where the
author stayed when on his journey from Derbent to Joulad. That
city of “Origens”, however, was also at an “Edil”, so that Schiltberger
may possibly have confounded its name of Ornas, Arnatch,
or Andjaz, with Ourjenj, equally situated on an “Edil” (in this
instance not the Terek but the Oxus); the possessions of his iron
lord extending from the neighbourhood of one river to that of the
other.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_36" id="Footnote_2_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_36">(2.)</a>  “A city called Haitzicherchen, which is a large city.”—Hadjy-tarkhan
was situated on the right bank of the Volga,
a few miles above the modern Astrahan, and near Itil, capital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>of the kingdom of the Khozars, an ancient city that had already
disappeared in the time of Rubruquis, 1253, when Hadjy-tarkhan
itself, it would appear, had scarcely begun to exist. Ibn Batouta
(1331) notes having sojourned at the last-named place upon the
occasion of his journey from Soudagh to Saraï; and Pegolotti says
that travellers tarried there when on their way to China. The
name appears as Azitarcan in the Catalan atlas, 1375, in which
work, and in the splendid map of the brothers Pizzigani, we also
find “Civitat de ssara”, or “Civitas Regio d’Sara”, the city of
New Sarai, destroyed by Timour, and mentioned by Schiltberger.
Its ruins are still to be seen near the town of Tzaref on the
Akhtouba, an arm of the Volga. There was, however, the other
Saraï, spoken of by Aboulfeda, Ibn Batouta, and Pegolotti, the
remains of which are visible, also on the Akhtouba, but at a distance
of two hundred miles to the south of Tzaref, and near Seliterny-gorodok,
where numerous coins of the khan Uzbek have
lately been found by a professor of the University of Kazan. No
such coins have ever been picked up at Tzaref, which is not surprising,
seeing that it was Janibek, the son of Uzbek, who
transferred his residence from Saraï to the new city of that name,
as Colonel Yule has already shown in one of his notes to Marco
Polo (i, 6), and as I have since sought to prove in an article that
was published at Kieff in 1876 (<cite>Troudy 3go. Archeo. Syezda</cite>).</p>

<p>Although old Saraï was depopulated by the plague in 1347–48,
and new Saraï was destroyed by Timour, both cities recovered
from those calamities, and in the later map of the world, by Fra
Mauro, they appear near a tributary on the left bank of the
Volga, but at a considerable distance from each other. The
northernmost is known to the Russians as Great Saraï.</p>

<p>Previously to selecting old Saraï for his residence, the khan
Barka was at Bolgar, the ancient capital of the kingdom of the
Bolgars on the Volga, which had been subdued in 1236 by his
brother and predecessor Batou, the “terrible Batou” of the Russians,
surnamed by the Tatars, Saïn—The Good. An indigent
Russian village stands on the site of the city, in the midst of
ruins which impress the traveller by their extent; an impression I
received when engaged in the Fourth Archæological Congress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>(1877), the members of which started upon their excursion from
Kazan, and descending the river to Spassky-zaton, visited the
locality distant seven miles in a direct line from the river. Considering
the importance of these ruins, the large extent of ground
they cover, the prodigious quantity of ancient oriental coins and
other antiquities that are being continually recovered; considering,
also, the testimony of Arabian authors and travellers on the
commercial relations of the ancient Bolgars of the Volga, the
question has frequently arisen—Why should that people have preferred
to establish themselves at so great a distance from the

blind”, instead of selecting a more advantageous site? The
enigma has been solved by Professor Golovkinsky (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sur la formation

that the Volga and the Kama have been subjected to great
changes in their course above their junction; that to a comparatively
recent period, the eastern bank of the bed where the two
rivers united, was close to the height upon which is the village of
Bolgar, and that this ancient bed is to be traced to an arm of the
Kazanka called the Boulak, and to the lake Kaban, both of which
flow through the city of Kazan, and through a partly dried up
marsh near the said village.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>which we find Sebur, near a chain of mountains called “los montes
de Sebur”, evidently the South Ural, styled Sibirsky kamian in a
Russian work on ancient hydrography (<cite>Knyga bolshem. Tchertejou</cite>,
151, St. P., 1838).</p>

<p>The Sibir of the Russians, known also as Isker, was situated on
the Irtysh, ten miles from Tobolsk; it was the residence of the
Shaïbani khans, and was taken in 1581 by a handful of Cossacks
under their ataman Yermak, who, in his turn, was besieged by
the Tatars, and lost his life in the river during a sortie (1584).
His countrymen have erected a monument at Tobolsk in honour
of this Russian Cortez.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

is now Azoff, was a place of great importance in the 14th and
15th centuries. It was completely destroyed by Timour in
1395, but the Venetians returned soon afterwards, as would
appear by the statement of Clavijo, that “six Venetian galleys
arrived at the great city of Constantinople to meet the ships which
were coming from Tana”. They maintained commercial intercourse
with Tana even after its destruction by the Tatars in 1410,
by the Turks in 1415, and later again by the Tatars; and there
is the evidence of De Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 43) that in 1421,
four Venetian vessels arrived at Caffa from that port. Schiltberger,
who visited Tana at this period or shortly afterwards,
proves that it had recovered its commercial prosperity, at all
events so far as regards the fisheries, a fact supported by Barbaro.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

may not have been aware that this latter name included
the whole of South Russia and the Crimea, of which, Solkhat,
afterwards Esky Crim, actually became the chief town. Neumann
believes the author to have made a mistake, which may have
arisen from the fact that in his time there were many princes, as
has already been shown, who disputed the sovereignty; and a
large portion of Kiptchak may have recognised the authority of
one or the other of those princes who had taken up his residence

Vithold in 1421, and who died at an unfortunate moment, because
the knight leaves us in ignorance of his name. I believe
that ruler to have been Ydegou, in the absence of any proof of
Hammer’s statement (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. G. H.</cite>, 352), that Vithold’s
old ally was the chief of an independent state on the shores of

from other sources, except with regard to the estimated

there were “two kinds of Jews” (the Talmudists and the Karaïms)
is a well-authenticated fact. The four towns at the sea-side, dependant
on Caffa, must have been Lusce, Gorzuni, Partenice, and
Ialita, now known as Aloushta, Gourzouff, Partenite, and Yalta, all

the “Kersona civitas Clementis” of Rubruquis (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil de Voy. et

<p>(10<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Sary kerman—Yellow Castle—was the name by which
Cherson, near modern Sevastópol, was known to Eastern writers.
Pope Clement I. was exiled by the Emperor Trajan to that part of
the Tauric Chersonesus, and suffered martyrdom by being thrown
into the sea. According to the legend, the sea receded upon
every anniversary of the saint’s death, leaving the body exposed
on the shore during the space of seven days, until in the 9th
century, Cyril and Methodius the Apostles of the Slaves (the
originators of the Slave alphabet), caused it to be interred at Cherson,
whence the remains were subsequently removed to Kieff by
the grand-prince Vladimir upon his conversion to Christianity.</p>

<p>The Church of Rome gives a different version of this legend,
and maintains that the relics of the pontiff are preserved in the
church of St. Clement on the Esquiline (<cite>The Crimea and Transc.</cite>,
i, 22, 98).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_11_36" id="Footnote_11_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_36">(11.)</a>  “they suppose that a man struck by lightning is a
saint.”—The “Starchas” or Tcherkess—Circassians—were known
to Giovanni dal Piano di Carpine, Aboulfeda, Barbaro and others,
and were more generally called Zikhes and Cossacks, two branches
of that people. The proof of the identity of the Zikhes with the
Cossacks or Tcherkess is to be found in Interiano (<cite>Ramusio edition</cite>,
196), who visited the country in 1502: “Zychi in lingua
vulgare, greca et latina cosi chiamati, et da Tartari et Turchi
dimandati Ciarcassi”. Their identity, however, is established in
the present work, and therefore before the Italian’s travels; it
being stated in chapter 56 that the Turks designate the “Sygun”—Zikhes—by
the name of “Ischerkas”—Tcherkess. In the days
of Constantine Porphyrogenitus (<cite>De Adm. Imp.</cite>, c. 42), their territory
extended along the Black Sea shore over a distance of three
hundred miles, from the river Oukroukh (Kouban), which separated
them from Tamatarcha (Taman), to the river Nicopsis at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>the frontier of Abhase, a country that reached to Soteriopolis
situated in all probability where is now Pytzounda the ancient
Pityus, to the north west of Soukhoum Kaleh, for it is stated by
Codinus (<cite>Hieroclis Synecdemus</cite>, etc., 315) that Pityus was at one
time called Soteropolis.</p>

<p>The Abhases and the Tcherkess speak different dialects of the
same tongue (Güldenstädt, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reisen durch Russl.</cite>, i, 463). The
former were converted to Christianity through the exertions of
the emperor Justinian, about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 550; but Christianity was
spread among the Zikhes previously to this, and if many adopted
the Mahomedan faith, proofs are not wanting that they did so
from political motives and to please the Turks (Marigny, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. dans
le pays des Tcherkesses</cite>, in Potocki, ii, 308). Their conversion to
Christianity has never kept them from a love of pillage and the
sale of their own children, as is reported of them by Schiltberger and
confirmed by Marigny, who is unable to conceive how a people to
whom freedom is the greatest boon could think of thus disposing
of their own offspring.</p>

<p>Marigny also confirms the statement that thunder was held
in great veneration by the Tcherkess. “They have no god of
lightning”, says this author, “but we should deceive ourselves
in supposing that they never had one. They hold thunder in
great veneration, for they say it is an angel who strikes the
elect of God. The remains of one killed by lightning are buried
with the greatest solemnity, and whilst mourning his loss, relatives
congratulate each other upon the distinction by which their
family has been visited. When the angel is on his aerial flight,
these people hurry out of their dwellings at the noise he makes;
and should he not be heard for any length of time, they pray
aloud entreating him to come to them.”—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(11<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) The Tcherkess, which include the Natouhaïtz, Shapsoughy,
Abadzehy, Abhase and other tribes, were known to Strabo
and Procopius as persistent slave dealers and pirates, occupations
which, according to the records of every age, they pursued unceasingly
until the complete subjugation and annexation of their
country by Russia in 1863. Dubois de Montpéreux (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. autour
du Caucase</cite>, etc., i, 258) says, writing in 1839, that even under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>the suzerainty of Russia the Abhases would not give up the
nefarious traffic which embraced, under certain circumstances, the
sale of a son or daughter or sister; and so lately as 1856, Oliphant
(<cite>Trans.-Cauc. Campaign</cite>, 125) found that the Abhases
indulged chiefly in the plunder of human beings. “Seizing the
handsomest boys and the prettiest girls, they would tear them
shrieking from their agonised parents, and swinging them on their
saddle-bow, gallop away with them through the forest, followed
by the cries and execrations of the whole population.”</p>

<p>The custom of placing the dead upon trees is practised at the
present time in Abhase, where they are suspended in coffins to
the branches, which creak as they are swayed by the wind, and
produce melancholy noises (<cite>The Crimea and Transc.</cite>, ii, 136).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_12_36" id="Footnote_12_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_36">(12.)</a>  “One is called Kayat, the other Inbu, the third Mugal.”—Considering
the little care taken by Schiltberger and his transcribers
to hand down to us proper and geographical names with
sufficient exactness to enable us to prove their identity, it is no
easy task to determine what were the “Kayat” and “Inbu” who,
with the Mongols, formed the population of Great Tatary. Whatever
the correct names, they were probably communicated to
Schiltberger by the natives or their Mongol chiefs. The latter
were able to distinguish from their own people, those who had
retained for a longer period than others their hereditary chiefs
under the suzerainty of the descendants of Jengiz Khan. The
principal tribes were undoubtedly the Keraït and Uïgour, whose
rulers, named Edekout, a name reminding us of the celebrated
“Edigi” whom Schiltberger accompanied to Siberia, preserved
their independence until the year 1328 (Erdmann, <cite>Temud. d.
U. R.</cite>, 245). Neumann asserts that two of the tribes named were
the Kajat or Kerait, and the Uighur, a statement he leaves unsupported;
we are therefore justified in assuming that reference
is made rather to the Kaïtak and Jambolouk, two tribes the
author must have had frequent opportunities of meeting.</p>

<p>In Masoudi’s time, the Kaïtak or Kaïdak inhabited the northern
slopes of the Caucasus towards the Caspian Sea. There, also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>Aboulfeda placed them, and there they are to this day. We
have seen how futile were their endeavours to oppose Timour
upon his last expedition against Toktamish, and that Romanists
and Christians of other denominations soon afterwards introduced
themselves amongst them; but that they had not discontinued
their evil practices is proved by the bitter experience of the Russian
merchant Nikitin, who was plundered when shipwrecked on
their coast in 1468. It was in vain that he sought to recover his
property, even though he appealed to Shirvan Shah, brother-in-law
to Ali Bek their prince (Dorn, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch einer Gesch. der
Schirwan-Sch.</cite>, 582). The Kaïtak were a people of sufficient
importance to have attracted the notice of Schiltberger, when he
passed through their territory on his way from Persia to Great
Tatary.</p>

<p>Whilst in those parts, the author must have spent some time
amongst the Nogaï of the tribes of Jambolouk or Yembolouk, as
they are designated by Thunmann (Büsching, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gr. Erdbeschr.</cite>, iv,
387), and who were so named because their earliest settlements
were near the Jem or Yemba which flows into the Caspian. It was
only towards the close of the 18th century that they moved to
the western shores of the Sea of Azoff, where they met with other
Nogaï, at a time that the territory was being annexed to the
Russian empire. The wandering life of these Tatars, and their
frequent internecine divisions, justify us in assuming that in
Schiltberger’s time the greater number, if not the whole of the
Jambolouks, had moved their encampments in a westerly direction,
and this explains why the Tatar duke met by De Lannoy
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 40) in 1421, who lived on the ground with all
his people, was named Jambo. It was in the power of the descendants
of that duke to remove to any other more convenient
site; it is, therefore, very possible, that the fortress and town of
Yabou, ceded in 1517 by the Crimean Khan to Sigismund of
Poland, together with other places on the Dnieper, may have
belonged to him (<cite>Sbornyk</cite> by Prince Obolensky, i, 88). I feel
that we are at liberty to infer from these several facts that the
“Inbu” were Tatars of the Jambolouk Horde.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_13_36" id="Footnote_13_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_36">(13.)</a>  “and has daily twenty thousand men at his court.”—In
writing after his own fashion the native name of Fostat as “Missir”,
erroneously called Old Cairo by Europeans (Abd-Allatif, <cite>S. de Sacy
edition</cite>, 424), Schiltberger imagined that the name was equally
applicable to Cairo, because at that period the two towns had
largely extended towards each other, so as to form one city. De
Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 80) distinguishes Cairo from Fostat or
Misr, which he calls Babylon, a name it had received in consequence
of the settlement there of a Babylonian colony in the reign
of Cambyses (Noroff, <cite>Pout. po Yeghyptou</cite>, i, 154). Even now the
Copts include a part of Cairo and of Fostat under the name of
Boblien—Little Babylon—the new Babylon of the writers of the
middle ages, who took it upon themselves to bestow on the sovereigns
of Egypt the title of Sultan of Babylon, and some of whom,
Arnold of Lubeck for instance (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichtschr. der Deutsch. Vorzeit.</cite>,
etc., xiii <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrhund.</cite> iii, 283), have even confounded the Euphrates
with the Nile. De Lannoy assists us in a measure to discern the
error into which Schiltberger has fallen ... “est à-sçavoir que
le Kaire, Babillonne et Boulacq furent jadis chascune ville à par
lui, mais à présent s’est tellement édiffiée, que ce n’est que une
mesme chose, et y a aucune manière de fossez entre deux plas sans
eaue, combien qu’il y a moult de maisons et chemins entre deux, et
peut avoir du Kaire à Babillonne trois milles et de Boulacq au
Kaire trois mille.” Noroff considered Boulak to be the Egyptian
Manchester, because of the manufactories established there by
Mehemet Ali. The population of the three towns was quite in
proportion to their extent, and certainly so continued until about
twenty years before De Lannoy’s arrival, when it decreased;
indeed it is stated by Aboul-Mahazin, that Egypt and Syria had
fallen preys to every sort of calamity during the reign of Faradj,
1399–1412. Apart from the Mongol invasion and incessant civil
war, those countries were assailed by the European maritime
powers, and visited by plague and famine, so that the population
was reduced by one-third.</p>

<p>There was a time when it was generally believed that the
people in Cairo could not be numbered, because it was considered
the most populous city in the world, with more inhabitants than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>all Italy contained, the vagabonds it sheltered sufficing to fill
Venice! In saying this, Breidenbach (Webb, <cite>A Survey of Egypt
and Syria</cite>, etc.) does not fail to observe: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Audita refero—neque
enim ipso numeravi.</span>” Schiltberger may have thought the same,
when he computed the streets in “Missir” to be as numerous
as were the houses in Caffa; and this he did that his readers
might be the better able to judge of the difference between the two
cities.</p>

<p>That the sultan’s suite consisted of twenty thousand men is
most probable, allusion being made to the dwellers in the citadel.
Thus, De Lanuoy:—“est ledit chastel moult grant comme une
ville fermée, et y habite dedens avecq le soudan grant quantité de
gens, en espécial bien le nombre de deux mille esclaves de cheval
qu’il paye à ses souldées comme ses meilleurs gens d’armes à
garder son corps, femmes et enffans, et autres gens grant
nombre.”</p>

<p>In 1778, thirty thousand people lived in the citadel, one half of
that number being troops (Parsons, <cite>Travels in Asia and Africa</cite>,
etc., 382).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

old slaves, arrogated to themselves the right of elevating to the
throne one of their own number, upon the death of the sultan.

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_37" id="Footnote_1_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_37">(1.)</a>  “and on the spike he must rot.”—Among those who had
reigned or assumed the supreme power in Egypt, appear the names
of “Marochloch” and “Jusuphda”, intended for Barkok and
Faradj; also “Mathas”, whose reign intervened between that of
“Marochloch” and “Jusuphda”. The successors of the latter
were “Zechem”, “Schyachin”, and “Malleckchafcharff” also
known as “Balmander”, who was no other than Boursbaï, 1422–1438;
he assumed upon his accession, according to custom, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>title of Ak Melyk, and the distinctive prefix of Alashraf Seif uddin
Aboul-Nazr—The most Noble Sword of the Faith, and Father of
Victory (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 167). “Mathas” was Mintash
or Mantash, governor of Malatia, who, after having for a time replaced
Barkok, perished in 1393 by being broken on the wheel.
It is possible, however, that Arabian authors have otherwise
described the mode of Mantash’s execution, through misapprehension,
because the sawing in two parts was a punishment of antiquity,
practised in eastern countries other than Egypt. Dion
Cassius (lxviii, 32) relates that the Jews in Cyrene and Egypt,
under Trajan, having revolted, sawed in two the Romans and
Greeks who fell into their hands, staining their faces with
the blood of their victims, and adorning themselves with the
skin. In one of the admirable notes to his translation of
Makrizi, Quatremère (i, 72, note 103) cites numerous instances of
this kind of punishment in Schiltberger’s day, not in Egypt only,
but also in Persia and among the Mongols. The Russian princes
captured after the battle of the Kalka, in 1223, were thus tortured
(Karamsin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Russie</cite>, iii, 291).</p>

<p>“Zechem” is to be identified with Jakam, governor of Syria,
who revolted against Faradj. He was acknowledged as sultan in
Syria, but succumbed in a war with Kara Yelek in 1405–06.</p>

<p>“Schyachin” is a name that slightly recalls to mind Sheykh
Mahmoud, sultan in 1421; he was successor to the caliph Abbas
al-mustein Billahy who reigned for a few months after the death
of Faradj in 1412; but Sheykh Mahmoud died a natural death
at an advanced age, and could not therefore have been the ruler
whose execution Schiltberger describes so minutely, that he must
have been a witness to his torments. None of Boursbaï’s predecessors—Ahmed,
the eldest son of Mahmoud—Tater, an old Mamelouk—or
Mohammed, the youngest son of Mahmoud, deposed by
Boursbaï, met with the fate of “Schyachin”, a name intended
perhaps for Azahiri, governor of Safad, who raised the standard
of revolt at the very commencement of Boursbaï’s reign. He
was deserted by his followers, and having surrendered was put
to torture, 1422, perhaps enduring the sufferings to which
“Schyachin” was subjected.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

this letter, with the titles it confers on the sultan, was the invention
of the Armenians who communicated it to the author; but there
is nothing very extraordinary or improbable in the statement, that
Boursbaï had sent letters to various Christian potentates upon the
occasion of his daughter’s marriage, because that sovereign entertained
diplomatic and commercial relations with the maritime republics
of Italy, with the kings of Aragon and Cyprus, and the
emperor of Byzantium, to each of whom, and not to the Pope, was
addressed the letter to “Rom”, a word allowably substituted for

an anachronism in styling himself the autocrat of Carthage,
for he could only have possessed the ruins of that city. As the
successor of the Fatimites, or protector of the Abbasside caliphate,
the sultan may have claimed Tunis, built partly at his own
expense, near the remains of Rome’s ancient rival, whose renown
in Africa must have survived, and whose name may therefore

substitute for Carthage that noted sanctuary of Islam, Kairvan,
called by Aboulfeda, Cayroan, and which was considered the most
beautiful city in Magreb.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

is applicable either to Sicily, which at one
time belonged to the Aghlabites, or still more so to Seville, called
Ishbilia by the Persians.</p>

<p>In a letter to Shah Rokh the son of Timour, in 833 of the
Hegira, the sultan Boursbaï styles himself Lord of Jerusalem;
possibly the sense of the passage turned by Schiltberger into
“ain herr des obristen gots,” which, being an imitation of the
Hebrew, was Hebrew to him.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_37" id="Footnote_5_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_37">(5.)</a>  “Capadocie.”—It is doubtful whether Boursbaï, or the
inventor of his titles, would have mentioned any one place for the
second time, yet the name “Capadocie” appears twice. In his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>letter to Shah Rokh, Boursbaï entitles Jerusalem, the Venerable;
so that this “Capadocie” may have been similarly intended for an
appellation, since the region of that name would be quite out of
place between Jerusalem and the Jordan. It is possible, however,
that for “Capadocie” we should read Capernaum, now known as
Tell-Hum, where are many ruins which comprise those of an
edifice surpassing in grandeur and magnificence anything
Robinson (<cite>Biblical Researches</cite>, etc.) saw in Palestine.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_37" id="Footnote_6_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_37">(6.)</a>  “her son our nephew of Nazareth.”—It may fairly be
doubted whether this passage was really included amongst the
sultan’s titles, its appearance in the MS. being due to some misconception
on the part of the author, from his being but indifferently
initiated in the mysteries of Mahomedanism; how, otherwise,
could he have supposed that his protector had entitled Jesus
his “neff”—nephew. With regard to Bethlehem and Nazareth,
names conceivably included in the list, Schiltberger may have
been informed that Mahomedans revere our Saviour as being one
of their own Neby or chief prophets; or he may have been told
that Christ was designated Neffs, Neps—spirit, soul. Jesus is
also called Rouh—the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Through some similar misconception, Boursbaï is made to boast
of his relationship to the Virgin Mary, which could not have been
the case either, seeing that she, in like manner, is venerated by
Mussulmans.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

the number seventy-two was employed by Asiatics to designate a
large number, is demonstrated by numerous examples, other than
the following. Seventy-two was the number of tribes in Syria;
of the Mahomedan sects; of the disciples of our Saviour; of the
Persian Mushids; of the towers of Jeziret-ibn-Omer, etc., etc. As
to the seventy-two towers of “Germoni”, Robinson (<cite>Biblical Researches</cite>,
etc.) has noted that Hermon is surrounded as if by a belt
of temples.</p>

<p>“Talapharum” is the well-known Tell-el-Faras at the termination
of Jabal-el-Heis, a spur of Jabal-el-Sheykh or Hermon.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_8_37" id="Footnote_8_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_37">(8.)</a>  “inhabited by seventy-two languages.”—This “great forest”
is the Caucasus, the extent of the great mountain range in a direct
line from sea to sea, agreeing exactly with the length given. The
seventy-two languages are the seventy-two nationalities (Dorn,
<cite>Geog. Cauc.</cite>, 221), each of which spoke a different tongue; they
were the seventy-two nations confined by Alexander beyond the
Caspian Gates.</p>

<p>There exists a tradition, that when upon his death-bed Mahomet
recommended to the faithful the conquest of the Caucasus, a
country he had ever held in special veneration, so that several
Shyite sects place it, in point of sanctity, above the cities of
Arabia (D’Ohsson, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Des Peup. du Cauc.</cite>, ii, 182). It is therefore
not at all strange that the sovereignty over a region so specially
blessed and in which the sultan himself was born, should have
been included amongst his dignities, since he was entitled, in a
measure, to consider the power of the founder of Alexandria to be
his heritage.</p>

<p>Claiming the monarchy, as he did, over the forests of the
Caucasus, the sultan naturally added thereunto his possession of
Cappadocia, a portion of which did indeed belong to him, and
wherein he had every right to situate Paradise. Mahomedans
believe, as do Christians and Jews, that the Garden was in a
beautiful land called Adn, watered by a marvellous river which
was the source of the Euphrates, of the Tigris, the Jihoun
(Pyramus of the ancients) and the Syhoun (Sarus), all in Cappadocia
or in its immediate neighbourhood. Really, Boursbaï
was no farther out in his calculations, than were those learned
men who recognised the two last-named rivers in the Oxus and
Jaxartes (Hammer), in the Araxes and Phasis (Brugsch), and even
in the Volga and Indus (Raumer)—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_9_37" id="Footnote_9_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_37">(9.)</a>  “the guardian of the caves.”—The disappearance, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 873,
at the age of twelve, of Mohammed the descendant of Ali and the
twelfth and last Imam, in a cave near Sermen Rey, distant thirty-two
miles from Baghdad, gave rise to numerous conjectures, all of
equal absurdity. The Shyites believe that this Mehdy, or celestial
judge, is still in the unknown cave, and they await his return as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>impatiently as do the Jews that of the Messiah. The Sunnites
are satisfied that when the world comes to an end, he will make
his appearance accompanied by three hundred and sixty celestial
spirits, and prevail upon the people of the earth to embrace
Islamism (D’Ohsson, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tableau. général de l’E. O.</cite>, i, 152).</p>

<p>The sultan of Egypt is said to have styled himself “the guardian
of the caves” (ein vogt der hellen), perhaps because the cavern
was under his protection; but it is also possible that for “hellen”
we should read Helle or Halle, the German for Hillah, on the site
of ancient Babylon, and celebrated for such holy places in its
neighbourhood as Kerbela and Mesjyd Ali, the Campo Santo to
which the Shyites perform pilgrimages (Ritter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Erdkunde</cite>
etc., ix, 842, 869, 955).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_10_37" id="Footnote_10_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_37">(10.)</a>  “Destructor of the Gods.”—It is impossible to agree with
Penzel, that Schiltberger entertained the strange notion of having
seen a protector of hell in that Boursbaï, whom Penzel himself
admits had glorified himself as being the friend of all gods (aller
Götter Freund), because the last title on the list is “Destructor
of the Gods” (Ain mäg der götter). But here Penzel is again at
fault in his interpretation of Schiltberger’s meaning, because the
monarch who claimed to be the Light of the true Faith (S. de
Sacy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chrestom. Arabe</cite>, 322), rather than boast of his friendship
for the gods, would have declared himself to be, in keeping with
the tenets of his religion, the implacable enemy to idolatry, a
destructor of gods, a Mahhy, transformed in the text into
“mäg”.</p>

<p>There is some difficulty in accounting for the sultan’s usurpation
of the title of “the mighty emperor of Constantinoppel”. In
his letter to Shah Rokh, alluded to in note 4, page 184, he wrote
as follows: “The kings of the earth have come from all parts as
the bearers of their homage. The King of Hormuz, the Sultan of
Hisn, the son of Karaman; these princes, sovereigns of their
countries, the Sultan of the revered city of Mecca, the Sultans of
Yemen, of Magreb, and of Tekrour, the King of Cyprus, since
dead, all have presented themselves at my Court”. This king of
Cyprus, who was named John and died in 1432, was captured by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>the Egyptians on their expedition to the island in 1426, and being
forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of the sultan, agreed to pay
annual tribute to the amount of twenty thousand dinars, to enable
him to obtain his freedom (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 177). John II.,
emperor of Byzantium, sought, but in vain, to intercede for the
king by entering into negociations with the sultan (<i>ibid.</i>, 173),
upon which occasion he may possibly have stooped to pay homage
as others did, for he was not ashamed at another time to prostrate
himself and kiss the Pope’s slipper. It is likely enough that he
presented himself under the name of Tekrour, a country Silvester
de Sacy is at a loss to determine. Tekrour, however, need not
have been the name of a country at all, but a corruption of
Takfour, a designation in the East for the emperor of Constantinople.</p>

<p>The homage of the ruling powers on earth, did not suffice to
satisfy the despot Boursbaï, for his ambition wafted him to the
skies (“the lord [of the places] where Enoch and Helyas are
buried”), the place of sepulture, say the Mahomedans, of their
prophets Enoch, and Elias the protector of travellers, and who is
believed by the Jews to have been borne away to heaven
(D’Ohsson, <i>l. c.</i>, i, 51, 111).</p>

<p>Another title, though less bombastic, is still more puzzling,
unless “Kaylamer” is to be identified with the fortress of
Kalamil visited in 1221 by Willbrand of Oldenburg (Viv. de
Saint-Martin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Desc. de l’A. M.</cite>, i, 488), after leaving Mamistra
(Mopsvesta of the ancients, Mimistra of the Byzantines, the actual
Missis). When upon this journey, Willbrand left on his right
hand a place called the King’s Black Castle, an indication that conducts
us with Saint-Martin to the defile known to the ancients as
the Pylæ Armeniæ or Pylæ Ciliciæ, now called Demyr Kapou by the
Turks; evidently the same locality as that noticed by Marino Sanudo
(<cite>Liber Secret. Fidel.</cite>, etc., 221—Pauthier, Marco Polo, cxxxii, 1).
“Tartari autem sequenti anno (1260) violenter irrumpentes,
ceperunt Alapiam, Harem, Hamam, Calamelam et Damascum.”
The fortress of Calamela being included among the chief cities in
Syria, it is to be inferred that its strategical and commercial
importance had greatly increased during the half century that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>transpired after Willbrand’s visit. Nor does Calamila seem to
have escaped the notice of Italian navigators, for the name,
slightly varied, appears in the hydrographic charts of the
14th century. In the Catalan atlas, 1375, for instance, Caramila
is evidently the same as the Cramela spoken of by the author of
<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Secretorum Fidelium</cite>, etc., who observes that it stood on
the site of ancient Issus, the gulf of this city being marked on
the chart, “golfo de Cramela”. At that time, Cramela divided
the possessions of the sultan of Egypt from those of the king of
Armenia; and considering its importance, the sultan may not
have disdained to style himself amir of Calamila, transformed
by Schiltberger into “Amorach of Kaylamer”.</p>

<p>The next name, “Galgarien”, is undoubtedly intended for
Khozary or Gazary, described by Marino Sanudo (Kunstmann,
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stud. über M. S.</cite> 105) as Galgaria, a dependancy of the Tatars,
inhabited by “Gothi et aliqui Alani”. It was a Genoese possession
in the Crimea, whence was carried on a large export trade, chiefly
in slaves to Alexandria, where many afterwards became men of
note; but Khozary was a dependancy of Kiptchak, a name that
signifies—hollow tree—the distinctive title immediately following
that of “the mighty emperor of Galgarien” as “the Lord of the
withered tree”. The rulers of Kiptchak, or khans of the Golden
Horde, were long bound by the strictest ties of friendship to the
sultans of Egypt, and as zealous followers of Mahomet, were not
likely to question their right to hold the first place among the
monarchs of Islam.</p>

<p>That the high position attained by those sultans did not
influence them against according their protection to Christian
potentates, is evident from the intimate relations that existed
between themselves and the kings or emperors of Abyssinia, among
whom should certainly be included “Prester John, in enclosed
Rumany”.</p>

<p>It is now generally admitted that Marco Polo, with his usual
good faith, stated the precise truth in affirming that in his time,
one George, a descendent of Prester John, became the governor of
a province as a vassal of China. This prince professed the
Roman Catholic faith, instead of Nestorianism as did his grandfather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>Ovang Khan, chief of the Keraits, and not, as Oppert has
sought to prove (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Presb. Johannes in Sage und Gesch.</cite>, etc., Berlin,
1864) of the Gour Khan of the Karakhitaians mentioned by Rubruquis.
In either case it is pretty certain that so soon as European
intercourse with the interior of Asia decreased, the existence of a
Christian state on the Nile, to the south of Egypt, became more
generally known; a state to which Haythoun, the Armenian historian,
had already directed the Pope’s attention (<cite>De Tartaria</cite>, c. 57,
apud Webb, <cite>A Survey of Egypt and Syria</cite>, etc., 394), and it thereafter
became the custom to metamorphose the Christian monarch of
the Nubians and Abyssinians into Prester John. Like Schiltberger,
De Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 93) knew of no other Prester John,
and far from admitting his dependance on the sultan, a condition
to be inferred by the title of protector attributed to the latter by
Schiltberger, the knight implies that it was rather the sultan who
was in a state of dependance on Prester John, in whose power it
lay to “destourber le cruschon” of the Nile, which he certainly
would have done, but for the fear of victimising the many
Christians in Egypt.</p>

<p>In another chapter, De Lannoy terms these Christians “Christians
of the girdle”, a name that was applied, says his commentator
(Webb), in consequence of a law promulgated <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 856 by the
caliph Motonakek, which prescribed that Jews and Christians
should wear a broad leathern girdle. It appears, however, that in
course of time the Nestorians and Jacobites also became subject
to the same law, and this accounts for the expression, “Prester
John, in enclosed Rumany”, which, if intended for Abyssinia, a
country mistaken by Marco Polo and De Lannoy for that of the
Brahmins, would indicate that the former was inhabited by
the Christians of the girdle. (De Lannoy styles the primate of
the Copts, the primate of India.) That they were believed to be
in Abyssinia is proved in the following lines from Juan de la
Encina’s narrative of his journey to Jerusalem in the year 1500.</p>

<p>This author evidently confounds the Georgians with the
Abhases and the latter with the Abyssinians, as had frequently
been done before him. In quoting from documents preserved
among the archives at Königsberg, a letter from Conrad of Jungingen,
Grand-Master of the Teutonic Order, dated January 20,
1407, and addressed to Prester John, “regi Abassiæ”, Karamsin
(<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Russie</cite>, iii, 388), observes, that the superscription applies
to the king of Abhase in the region of the Caucasus, and not to
the king of Abyssinia. We read, likewise, in the chronicle of
Alberic (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rel. de Jean du Plan de Carpin</cite>, 161) that the legate
Pelagius “misit nuntios suos in Abyssiniam terram et Georgianorum,
qui sunt viri catholici”.</p>

<p>The friendship that existed between the “negus christianissimus”
and the sultan was certainly but rarely interrupted, probably
because they sympathised in each other’s apprehensions; but the
sentiments entertained by Boursbaï towards the caliph, must
have been of a different nature, so that he may have taken
upon himself to borrow the title of “guardian of Wadach”, or
Baghdad.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_11_37" id="Footnote_11_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_37">(11.)</a>  “This is done on all the roads of the king-sultan.”—It
would appear that during the author’s stay in Egypt, the ladies
of that country exceeded all bounds in the abuse of the freedom
they were permitted to enjoy during the Baïram festivities, judging
by the severe measures adopted by the sultan, to their prejudice,
in 1432 (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, v, 208). It was forbidden to every
woman, and there were no exceptions, to leave her house, so that
the unmarried even incurred the risk of dying of starvation. This
law was subsequently modified in favour of coloured slaves and
old women, and the young were only permitted to leave their
home for the bath, on the express understanding that they returned
immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>By another decree, promulgated in the early part of his reign,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>the sultan Boursbaï abolished the ancient custom which required
that the ground should be kissed by all who were admitted to his
presence; and it was thenceforth ordained, that according to the
rank of the person introduced, so his hand or the hem of his garment
should be kissed. But he was soon persuaded to resort to
the old usage, except that instead of kissing the ground with the
mouth, those presented were to touch the ground with the hand,
which was then to be kissed. Schiltberger could not have been in
Egypt before the abolition of the above ridiculous and barbarous
custom, in the first year of Boursbaï’s reign; but there were no
doubt numerous instances in his day of obsequious courtiers and
other parasites who did actually kiss the ground. The ceremonial
and etiquette observed at the presentation and reception of ambassadors,
was in accordance with the customs of the Turks and
Tatars upon such occasions.</p>

<p>The little bell for post-horses was introduced by the Mongols

were employed in Asia as earners, in very remote times. It was
pigeon service of which the daughter of the governor of Atra,
Hatra, or al Hadr, availed herself, that enabled Sapor, king of
Persia, 240–271, to capture the city which the emperor Severus
had failed to take. It is recorded by numerous European and
Eastern writers, that the pigeon-post was in general use in Syria
and Egypt during the Crusades. In his story of the Crusade
under Henry VI., in 1196, Arnold, bishop of Lubeck, describes the
training of pigeons, which was similar to what we read in the text,
and observes that “the Infidels are more highly gifted than the
children of light”, the training of pigeons being the invention of
the Infidels, whose practice was imitated by their enemies.
After the fall of Baïrouth in 1197, Boemund, prince of Antioch,
announced the good tidings to his subjects by despatching a
pigeon.</p>

<p>Khalil Daheri (Quatremère, i, 55, note 77), an Arabian writer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>of the 15th century, reports that Belbeis, Salehieh, Katia, and
Varradeh or Barideh, were the pigeon-post stations on the road to
Syria. According to Makrizi (<i>ibid.</i>, 56), Varradeh was distant
eighteen miles from Alarih. Query? Fort Arich or el-Arich in

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_38" id="Footnote_1_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_38">(1.)</a>  “The Infidels call the mountain Muntagi.”—Hushan dagh,
the correct name given by the Arabs, is here handed down to us
as “Muntagi”, which differs so widely from the native appellation
of Sinaï, that it may have been derived from the word Montagna,
possibly the generic name by which the mount was known to pilgrims.
In such a case, Schiltberger’s companions would have been
Italians, who, on the supposition that they were mariners, supplied
him with the details he gives on the Red Sea—its breadth, which
is represented at double its actual extent—and the information
that it had to be crossed to attain Sinai; although we know from
De Lannoy that the journey from Egypt was performed “en
costiant la mer”. The knight makes no mention of the wonderful
supply of oil at the monastery of St. Catherine, nor of the other
miracles performed by the saint; but he explains why the Infidels
went to Sinai. At the foot of the mount was a church of St.
Catherine, “à manière d’un chastel, forte et quarrée, où les trois
lois de Jhésu-Crist, de Moyse et de Mahommet sont en trois églises
représentées”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) This somewhat confused description of St. Catherine’s
mount and of Mount Sinaï, is to be accounted for by Schiltberger’s
statement that he had not ascended the latter, and that he described
the sites from hearsay only. He distinguishes, however,
St. Catherine from what he calls “Muntagi, the mountain of the
apparition”, upon which, as he was informed, God appeared to
Moses in a burning bush; where flows the spring from the rock
that Moses struck with his staff; the site where our Lord delivered
to him the tables with the ten Commandments, etc., etc. “Muntagi”
may therefore have been intended for Musa dagh, the
Turkish, as Jabal Musa is the Arabic for Mountain of Moses, about
which, in the words of Dean Stanley (<cite>Sinai and Palestine</cite>, 39)
the traditions of Israel have lingered, certainly since the 6th
century, and perhaps from a still earlier date. Mount Sinaï is
called Tur Sina by Ibn Haukal, and Jabal Tur and Et Tur by
Edrisi and Aboulfeda.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

by which name Hebron also was known (Gen. xii, 18; xxxv, 27),
and was probably so called after Mamre the Amorite, the friend
of Abraham (Gen. xiv, 13). Sir John Mandevile’s tradition of the
Dry Tree (<cite>Voyages and Travels</cite>, etc.) as it was related to him,
agrees almost word for word with the tale in the text, except that
Sir John saw an oak, whereas Schiltberger’s tree was called by the
Infidels “carpe” (Sir John writes Dirpe), and selvy is the Turkish
for cypress. Commentators on the Holy Scriptures have said that
plains of Mamre (Gen. xiii, 18; xviii, 1) is a mis-translation for
oaks of Mamre, but the Turkish for oak is meyshe. The great
tree seen by Robinson in 1838 (<cite>Biblical Researches</cite>, etc., ii, 81)
was an oak; it measured 22-1/2 feet in circumference in the lower
part, the branches extending over a diameter of 89 feet. It stood
solitarily near a well in the midst of a field, and was sound and in
a thriving state. A long and comprehensive note on the Arbre
Sec or Arbre Sol, will be found in Yule’s Marco Polo, i, 132.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p>“Carpe” may have indicated the caroub or locust tree (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
charube von Kufin</cite>; see Rosen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Patriarchengruft zu Hebron</cite>, in
<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift f. allg. Erdk.</cite>, neue Folge, xiv, 426), or the turpentine
tree, which Josephus and others have stated grew in those parts,
where a small and sterile valley still bears the significant name of
Sallet-el-Boutmeh—Place of the Turpentine tree. In course of
time, the turpentine tree of Josephus became confounded with
Abraham’s oak, mentioned in the Bible, which the Russian pilgrim
Daniel (Noroff, <cite>Péler. en T. S.</cite>, 77) says he found in leaf, and
might have been a huge tree of the sort noticed by Robinson.
The tree seen by Schiltberger must have been of another kind,
because it was withered; he could not otherwise have transmitted
to us the prophecy so encouraging to our own desires, and in
accordance with the presentiments of the Infidels themselves,
that the day will come when they shall be expelled from the holy
places.</p>

<p>No person is allowed to enter the mosque wherein the holy
patriarchs lie (see <a href="#Page_60">page 60</a>), as was the case in the 15th century,
unless provided with the sultan’s firman. We are told by Novairi
and other authors (Makrizi by Quatremère, ii, 249), that when the
sultan Bibars, 1260–1264, visited Khalil (Hebron), and learnt that
Christians and Jews were permitted to enter upon payment of a
fee, he at once put a stop to the practice. Hammer (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der
Ilchane</cite>, etc., 129) states that Mussulmans have held Hebron in
great estimation since the reign of the caliph Mostershid (stabbed
to death by an assassin in 1120), when the remains of several
bodies found in the caves, were passed off as being those of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, although, according to Moses, they
were interred at Hebron, where their places of sepulture are
pointed out by Christians.</p>

<p>The author of Itinerarium Hierosolymitanum (Parthey et Pinder,
<cite>Itiner. Ant. Aug.</cite>, etc., 283) thus writes with reference to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>beautiful church constructed by Constantine the Great near the
turpentine tree of Abraham: “Inde Terebinth Cebron mil. ii, ubi
est memoria per quadrum ex lapidibus miræ pulchritudinis, in
qua positi sunt Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarra, Rebecca et Lea.”</p>

<p>About the year 600, there was already a cathedral in the
quadrum, and twelve months later Bishop Arnulphus found the
monolith cenotaphs of the three patriarchs, one being that of
Adam; other smaller ones were assigned to their wives. At that
period Hebron belonged to the Arabs, who gloried in their descent
from Abraham, which accounts for the erection by them of a
mosque over the remains of their ancestor. It was only after the
conquest of Jerusalem by the Crusaders that the place was made
over to the Christians for religious purposes; this we learn from
Sœwulf (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil de Voy. et de Mém.</cite>, etc., 817–854) who went to
Palestine in 1102, and the Russian pilgrim Daniel (Noroff, <cite>Péler.
en T. S.</cite>, 95), who in 1115 saw a superb edifice at Hebron, in the
crypt of which was the sepulchre of the patriarch within a chapel
of circular form. Rosen says that the presence of Jews within
this sanctuary was tolerated by the Crusaders, a privilege, however,
for which they had to pay, according to the evidence of
Benjamin of Tudela, and of his co-religionist Petachy of Ratisbon,
who travelled in Palestine twelve years later. Hebron passed
into the hands of the Mussulmans long before the fall of Acre,
after which event the Christians in their turn were taxed for the
liberty of entering.</p>

<p>Among those of Schiltberger’s predecessors who have left an
account of what they saw and learnt during their sojourn in
Palestine, are the German monk, Brocardus, towards the close of
the 13th century—Sir John Mandevile, 1372—and the German
pilgrim, Ludolph von Suchem, whose work, <cite>Libellus de Itinere ad
T. S.</cite>, is considered the best itinerary for the Holy Land in the
14th century.</p>

<p>De Lannoy was in Palestine at about the same time as the
author, but does not report having been at Hebron; he however
supplies a list of the holy places, that was compiled, as he states,
by Pope Sylvester at the request of the emperor Constantine and
of “Sainte Helaine”, his mother. Three cities of “Ebron” are included:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>“La neufve et la moienne, de laquelle est l’esglise où
sont ensepvelis Adam, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob et leurs femmes”....
“<i>Item</i>, Ebron, la vielle, en laquelle David regna sept ans
et six mois.” It is desirable that these two passages should be
quoted, because in the works I have cited, such as Noroff’s,
Raumer’s, Rosen’s, and in others which dwell largely on Hebron,
one city only of the name is mentioned.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_39" id="Footnote_3_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_39">(3.)</a>  “but now there is only a pillar.”—If tradition is to be
relied on, it was the mother of Constantine who built the Church
of the Annunciation, which had already ceased to exist in Schiltberger’s
time. In 1620 a handsome church was erected on the
same site (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., 136), and a column at the foot
of seventeen steps indicated the spot where the angel Gabriel
appeared to the Virgin; it was possibly the pillar referred to in
the text. The pilgrim Daniel describes the earliest church,
situated in the centre of the city, as being large and handsome,
and enclosing three altars. It was destroyed by the sultan
Bibars in 1263 (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, iv, 46; Makrizi by Quatremère,
I, i, 200).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XL.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_40" id="Footnote_1_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_40">(1.)</a>  “I went twice to Jherusalem with a koldigen.”—Schiltberger’s
commentators have not been able to identify the word
“koldigen”, to which Koehler (<cite>Germania</cite>, vii, 371–380) puts a
mark of interrogation, observing that it is written in precisely
the same manner in two early editions. Frescobaldi in 1384
(<cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Viaggi in Terra Santa</cite>) speaks of the monks at the monastery on
Sinaï as Calores, instead of Καλογέροι. If Joseph, Schiltberger’s
companion, was a Christian, he might very possibly have been a
Kalogeros, a title turned into “Koldigen”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Another suggestion! Khodja is a corruption of the Persian
word Khaja, a term that in the East generally denotes a
merchant (Garcin de Tassy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Noms Propres et les Titres
Musulm.</cite>, 68). Or an interpretation of “Koldigen” is perhaps to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>be found in Koul, the Turkish for a detachment or small body of
men, and jy, a termination significative of office, profession, or
trade, as for instance, arabajy, one who drives; kayikjy, a boatman;
ghemijy, a sailor, and similarly, Kouljy, one who leads a
body of men. In European Turkey, however, Kouljy means also
a coast-guard-man, and in other parts of that empire the term is
applied to a keeper or custodian. In his Russian edition, Professor
Bruun submits the word Koljy derived from Koll, the title
of those of the second class of the Monastic Order of Kalender,
the founder of which Order, singularly enough, was one named
Joseph. With the reader must remain the privilege of deciding
upon Joseph’s calling, whether monk, merchant, coast-guard-man,
or custodian!—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_40" id="Footnote_2_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_40">(2.)</a>  “The Infidels call Jherusalem, Kurtzitalil.”—Jerusalem is
called by the Turks, Kouds Shereef, with the first part of which
name might be associated the first syllable “Kurtz”; but Shereef
could scarcely have been corrupted to “italil”, which reminds
me of Halil, a term pre-eminently applied to Abraham the
friend of God, and given to the gate of the city that leads to
Hebron, known as the Bab-el-Halil (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc.,
201).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_40" id="Footnote_3_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_40">(3.)</a>  “the pilgrims can kiss and touch it.”—The Russian pilgrim
Daniel observed three openings in the marble slab, through
which the sacred stone could be seen and kissed; but the indiscreet
zeal of pilgrims, says Noroff, who contrived to chip off
fragments, necessitated its protection from further mutilation.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_40" id="Footnote_4_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_40">(4.)</a>  “a brightness above the holy sepulchre, that is like fire.”—Some
people believed that this miracle was performed through
the intervention of a dove, while others attributed it to lightning.
The Russian pilgrim Daniel explains to his readers that it is only
those who have not attended during the celebration in church
that could be sceptic as to the appearance of this light from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>heaven, and he trusts that the truly faithful and of good repute
will believe in all the miracles that take place within the
sanctuary! He concludes his observations by quoting Luke xvi,
10.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(4<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Of the lamp that burned in front of the Holy Sepulchre,
Sir John Mandevile has also recorded that “it went out of itself,
on Good Friday, and again lit itself at the hour that our Lord
rose from the dead.” This lamp Schiltberger may have seen, but
it appears doubtful whether he witnessed the performance of the
miracle of the Holy Fire, “the brightness above the Holy Sepulchre,
that is like fire”, or he surely would have described the
supernatural occurrence.</p>

<p>This Easter miracle at the Holy Sepulchre has been the theme
of most travellers who have witnessed it ever since the days of
Charlemagne. Henry Maundrell (<cite>Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem</cite>,
etc., 96) was present at the Easter festival (1697) during the
ceremony kept up by the Greeks and Armenians, upon the persuasion
that every Easter a miraculous flame descends from heaven
into the Holy Sepulchre. He describes the fearful tumult and
clamour made by the people in their wild excitement in anticipation
of the miraculous appearance of the Holy Fire at the sepulchre, produced,
as he exposes, by the two miracle-mongers, the Greek and
Armenian bishops, who had entered the sepulchre alone for the
purpose. When they issued with two blazing torches in their
hands, all the people rushed with candles that they might obtain
the purest fire sent down from heaven, which they instantly
applied to their beards, faces, and bosoms, pretending that it
would not burn like an earthly flame; but Maundrell says he saw
plainly that none could endure the experiment long enough to
make good that pretension.</p>

<p>Dean Stanley, who was at Jerusalem in 1853 (<cite>Sinaï and Palestine</cite>,
467), states that Maundrell’s account is an almost exact
transcript of what was still to be seen. Captain Warren also
witnessed the strange doings in 1867–70 (<cite>Underground Jerusalem</cite>,
429–437); and in <cite>The Graphic</cite>, Sept. 21, 1878, was published an
interesting illustration of the interior of the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre during the performance of the miracle, together with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>short account of the proceedings. “After a procession of bishops
and priests thrice round the building, the Patriarch enters the
Sepulchre. Now the noise becomes greater and greater ...
making the place more like an Inferno than the Church of Christ....
The Holy Fire now issues from the holes in the walls,
and hundreds of hands are stretched out as they frantically try
to light their candles at the flame.... By this time one candle
has ignited the other, and the crowd below is one mass of moving
flame.” There is no abatement, in this the 19th century, in
the huge sham, with its attendant blind superstition and noisy
demonstrations.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_40" id="Footnote_5_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_40">(5.)</a>  “the priests from the country of Prester John.”—Upon
descending the steps on the east side of Calvary (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>,
etc., 301), another flight of twenty-four steps is reached, at
the foot of which is the Chapel of St. Helena, whence another
flight of eleven steps conducts to the place where the cross of
Christ and those of the two thieves were found. Here is an altar
of the Latin church. The chapel of the Jacobites must have
been higher up, near the Chapel of St. John which enclosed the
tomb of the Baron of the Holy Sepulchre and of his brother, the
first king of Jerusalem; interesting monuments that have been
destroyed, not by the Turks but by the Greeks (Richter, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wallfahrten
in Morgenlande</cite>, 22).—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_40" id="Footnote_6_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_40">(6.)</a>  “the church of Saint Steffan, where he was stoned.”—It
is asserted on tradition (Noroff, <cite>Péler. en T. S.</cite>, 19) that St.
Stephen was stoned in front of the sepulchre of the Holy Virgin,
on the road that leads from the Gate of St. Stephen, called also
the Gate of Gethsemane. But there was another gate on the
north side of the city, that was named by the Crusaders after the
first Christian martyr, because it was believed that he was stoned
in front of it; this gate is now the Gate of Damascus.</p>

<p>Noroff states further, that in ancient times there was upon the
same side a church of St. Stephen, which was demolished by the
Christians in consequence of its proximity to the walls, and
because it presented an obstacle to their defence. Daniel the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>Russian pilgrim, saw that church intact, and asserts that St.
Stephen there met his death and was buried. Schiltberger, no
doubt, found it in ruins. De Lannoy, without mentioning the
church, was of opinion that the martyr suffered death close to the
gate which bore his name, the spot being near Kedron and the
sepulchre of the Holy Virgin. The old chronicler Adamnanus
(Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., 312, note 92), in describing the basilica
of Zion with its cœnaculum, says: “Hic petra monstratur supra
quam Stephanus lapidatus extra civitatem obdormitavit.” According
to Daniel, Zion was not within the city.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_7_40" id="Footnote_7_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_40">(7.)</a>  “Another hospital that rests on fifty-four marble columns.”—The
ruins of this, the palace of the Hospitallers or Knights of the
Order of St. John of Jerusalem, are still to be seen to the south
of, and at no great distance from the Church of the Resurrection.
A church and monastery dedicated to the Holy Virgin were
erected on this spot in 1048; and shortly afterwards were
constructed near these edifices, another church, a monastery,
and hospital, dedicated to St. John the Baptist. Gerard, almoner
of this hospital, instituted in 1118 the celebrated Order of
Hospitallers.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(7<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Benjamin of Tudela knew of two hospitals at Jerusalem
which supported four hundred knights, and afforded shelter to the
sick. The four hundred knights were ever ready to wage war
together with those who came from the country of the Franks.
One hospital was called that of Salmon, having been originally
the palace built by Solomon.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_8_40" id="Footnote_8_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_40">(8.)</a>  “Infidels do not allow either Christians or Jews to enter it.”—This
must be the place where Omar about the year 640 constructed
the great mosque, afterwards converted into a Christian church
that was named Τὰ Ἅγια τῶν Ἁγίων. The Crusaders called it
Templum Domini, by which designation it was known to Schiltberger,
although it was in the hands of the Mahomedans.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_9_40" id="Footnote_9_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_40">(9.)</a>  “called the throne of Salomon.”—This has reference to the
site of the mosque of Aksa, previously the Church of the Presentation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>of the Virgin, built by Justinian in 530. The Russian
pilgrim, Daniel, saw it in the wrecked state to which it had been
reduced at the conquest of Jerusalem by the Franks, who there
met with the most determined resistance on the part of the
Mussulmans.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_10_40" id="Footnote_10_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_40">(10.)</a>  “there our Lord healed the bed-ridden man.”—It was
generally supposed that the pool and the palace of the templars
occupied the site of the temple of Solomon, close to the mosque
of Aksa (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., 297). Daniel knew of the
residence of Solomon only, because the palace was not constructed
until the Order of Hospitallers was established in 1119, that is
to say, four or five years after his stay in the Holy Land. The
church, and the dwellings of the templars, were destroyed in 1187
by Saladin, so that there was nothing for Schiltberger to see but
their remains.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_11_40" id="Footnote_11_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_40">(11.)</a>  “the house of Herod.”—At no great distance from the pool,
stood a house said to have been that of Pilate; the modern edifice
on the south side of the Sakhara or mosque constructed by Omar
in 637, is the residence of the pasha. It is supposed that the
palace of Herod was farther away to the east, and to the right of
the Via Dolorosa.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_12_40" id="Footnote_12_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_40">(12.)</a>  “A church, called that of Saint Annen,” is noticed by De
Lannoy, who adds that this was the birth-place of St. Anne, the
mother of the Virgin Mary; but he makes no allusion to the
head of St. Stephen, or the arm of St. John Chrysostom, relics
which, through some mistake of the author, or of a scribe, have
usurped the place of those of St. Joachim the spouse of St.
Anne. Daniel asserts that a church consecrated to the latter
existed in his day; it stood over their dwelling and place of burial.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_13_40" id="Footnote_13_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_40">(13.)</a>  “Mount Syon ... stands higher than the city.”—The
wall constructed by Souleiman, the Magnificent, 1536–1539,
traverses the ridge of the hills. Within it, near an Armenian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>chapel, is pointed out the house of Annas, and at a short distance
is the principal church of the Armenians, dedicated to St. James
the Elder who was there beheaded. Within the wall stood the
house of Caiphas the high priest, now the Church of the Holy
Saviour also belonging to the Armenians, and in which is preserved
the slab that closed the Saviour’s tomb. This is probably the
same church as described by Schiltberger; called that of the Holy
Saviour by De Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 54), who says that it was
in the occupation of Catholics, or perhaps of Armenians who
recognised the supremacy of the Pope, but not of the Gregorians.
This church could not have existed in the time of Daniel, because
he simply mentions the house of Caiphas.</p>

<p>Close at hand was the cœnaculum, in which the Last Supper
took place—where the Holy Ghost fell on the apostles—where the
Holy Virgin expired, and where Jesus Christ washed the apostles’
feet. The Church of Zion or of the Virgin Mary, that stood here
and is described by Daniel and others, was afterwards occupied by
the Franciscan friars, and eventually became a mosque. William
of Tyre (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., 312), Schiltberger and his
contemporaries, Zosimus (<cite>Pout. Rouss. loud.</cite>, ii, 50) and De
Lannoy, all agree that here was the tomb of St. Stephen; De
Lannoy, however, adds that it was the second place of his interment.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

citadel on the western side of the mount was constructed
during the Crusades by the Pisans, the tower of David which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>by the Empress Helena. Tobler (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Siloahquelle</cite>, 149), who
has taken the trouble to record the number of steps counted by
thirty-eight travellers, his predecessors, without however including
Schiltberger, places the tomb of the Virgin at the foot of forty-seven
steps. Near the above edifice are four sepulchral monuments
that have been differently described, as their origin is
unknown. Their style is partly Greek and partly Egyptian, and
they somewhat resemble the monuments at Petra. They are fully
described by Robinson, <cite>Biblical Researches</cite>, etc., and Kraft, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die
Topographie Jerusalems</cite>, Berlin, 1846.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

the northern summit of the Mount of Olives, on which was the
tower Viri Galilei, so called because two men in white stood there
at the moment of the Ascension (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., 310).
De Lannoy refers to this spot when describing pilgrimages to the
Mount of Olives: “<i>Item</i>, le lieu de Galilée, où Jhésu-Crist s’apparut

(<cite>Wars</cite>, etc., iv, 8, 3) wrote that the Dead Sea was
580 stadia in length, and 150 stadia wide. Seetzen (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reiseberichte
in Monatliche Correspondenz</cite>, Berlin, 1854, xviii, 440), gives the
width at 13-1/2 English miles, which Robinson reduces to 11-1/4 miles,
at the same time observing that the water level rose from 10 feet
to 15 feet; and that when he happened to be there in the month
of May, the water had sufficiently risen to inundate, over the space
of one mile, a salt lake on its southern shore. The indications of
Josephus and of Schiltberger may have reference to the same
season of the year.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(18<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Captain Warren (<cite>Underground Jerusalem</cite>, 175) gives
much new and valuable information on the Jordan and the valley
of that river, and explains that the rise and fall in the level of the
Dead Sea is caused by the fluctuations in the rush of water, the
time of greater evaporations not coinciding with that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>freshets. This rise and fall might possibly be greater, were there
no other regulating arrangement than evaporation; but at the
southern end there is a vast tract of land, only submerged by a
few feet (here is Robinson’s salt lake), and when this is covered
the evaporation is great; and should the waters be unduly
extracted, this becomes dry land. The Jordan overflows its banks
at harvest time, which is simply owing to the harvest being early
in that semi-tropical district, when the waters of the river are
swollen by the waters of Hermon. The disparity in the dimensions
of the Dead Sea, as noted by different authors, is here
accounted for and explained. See Duc de Luynes’ <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. d’Exploration

bring them to the Jordan, and they assemble at the ruins of a

Baptist. The church was equally a ruin in Daniel’s time, but the
monastery and vaulted chapel near Hermon were in existence. It
is clear that this mount could not have been either the great
Hermon of the Lebanon, or the lesser Hermon which is situated
in the middle of the plain of Jezreel to the south of Mount
Tabor.</p>

<p>The monastery of St. John the Baptist (De Lannoy) was
perhaps identical with that constructed, according to Adamnanus
(Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., 60), by St. Helena, at the place where
Christ was baptised. Pocock (<cite>Desc. of the East</cite>, etc., ii, 49) makes
it distant one mile from the Jordan, and says that Greeks and
Latins, who are at issue as to the exact locality, are mistaken in
seeking it on the western bank of the river, John having baptised
at Bethany beyond the Jordan. Noroff (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Péler. en T. S.</cite>, 49) points
out that Pocock himself is in error, and that the Greeks and
Latins were quite right in keeping to the western bank, in front
of Bethabara and not of Bethany.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

Josephus to Burkhardt, have derived the name of the river
Jordan from the two springs, Jor and Dan, although the sources
are in reality the Banias, Dan, and Hasbeny; so that every
allowance should be made if Schiltberger has failed to give the
correct etymology of the name, which signifies in Hebrew “that
which flows downwards”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

beautiful plain was in all probability the valley of Jericho,
watered by the Jordan after it leaves the lake of Tiberias or
Gennesareth, and traverses two calcareous hills, described by
Justin in words similar to those of Schiltberger,—“Est namque
vallis quæ continuis montibus velut muro quodam clauditur.”</p>

<p>The valley of Jericho, compared by Josephus to a paradise,
θεῶν χωρίον, tractum divinum, is far from meriting such encomium,
even though we cannot but agree with Ritter that,
considering the profusion and utility of the vegetation still
growing wildly in this fertile valley, and the scattered remains
of old aqueducts, it must have been one of the most beautiful
gardens in Palestine whilst in a state of cultivation during the
Crusades.</p>

<p>That the sepulchre of St. James was in this valley is a very
puzzling statement, because it is asserted on tradition that the
Apostle of that name, surnamed the Elder, was beheaded on Mount
Zion, on the spot where stands the church that bears his name;
it is alluded to by Schiltberger and De Lannoy, and is actually in
the custody of the Armenians, who state that the head of the saint
was carried off to Spain, Quaresimus (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elucidatio Terræ Sanctæ</cite>,
ii, 77) asserting that the body, as well as the head, is at Campostella.
According to Daniel and De Lannoy, the tomb of St. James
the Less was in the valley of Josaphat, near that of the prophet
Zacharias, close to which, says Schiltberger, reposed the remains
of the prophet Jacob, a name substituted for that of James, or
rather James the Less, who, it is said, concealed himself in a tomb
near to that of Zacharias, upon the day that our Lord was
betrayed.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

holy places had been frequently won and lost during the Crusades,
but they were never again recovered from the Egyptians, after the
expulsion of the Mongols from Syria by the sultan Koutouz and
his amir Beïbars in 1260, the year 658 of the Hegira. Schiltberger’s
error in computation, of twenty years, probably arose from his
having added the years of this date, 658 instead of 638 to the 622
years that had elapsed from the birth of Christ to the commencement
of the Mahomedan era. These dates amount together to 1280,
which he must have thought corresponded to 658 of the Hegira,
the period indicated to him as that at which Mussulman rule was
established in Syria and Palestine, and Christians lost their influence.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_23_40" id="Footnote_23_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_40">(23.)</a>  “and this they do that they may make more profit.”—Many
travellers in Egypt, whether previous to, during, or since
the Crusades, have noticed that balsam was to be obtained only
from the Matarea garden near Cairo. To his translation of Abd-Allatif’s
description of Egypt, Silvester de Sacy adds several passages
on the cultivation of balsam in that country, being extracts
from the reports of European and Eastern writers; but he omits
Arnold of Lubeck and De Lannoy. Whilst at Cairo, the latter was
presented by the patriarch of India with a “fyole de fin balme de
la vigne, où il croist, dont il est en partie seigneur”; and he repeats
the tradition related by Brocardus (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terræ Sanctæ Descr.</cite>, 311),
that the vine of the balsam had been brought to Babylon, meaning
Cairo, by Cleopatra.</p>

<p>Schiltberger was in Syria and Egypt at about the same time as De
Lannoy, and may have heard this tradition, also the legend that
was related to the Bishop of Lubeck, to the effect that the balsam
tree did not put forth in the garden of Matarea until the Virgin,
in passing by when on her flight from the persecutions of Herod, had
washed her son’s clothes in the stream that irrigated the garden.
Makrizi associates this very fable with the well at Matarea, adding,
that the balm-tree had quite disappeared from the country about
the Jordan where it was formerly exclusively obtained. Strabo
(<span class="smcap">XVI</span>, ii, 41) and Pliny (<span class="smcap">XII</span>, v, 4) both say that this plant was cultivated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>in the royal gardens at Jericho, of which it was the chief
ornament (Josephus, <cite>Wars</cite>, etc., iv, 8); but it is doubtful whether
it disappeared entirely from Judæa after the days of Cleopatra
and Augustus, because some was purchased at Jerusalem in 705
by St. Guillebaud (cited by S. de Sacy, Abd-Allatif, 91); and
Burkhardt learnt that balm-oil was to be obtained at Tiberias, extracted
from a fruit that greatly resembled the cucumber, and
grew on a stem very like the balsam tree at Mecca.</p>

<p>Now-a-days, a sort of oil, produced from the myrobalsamum and
prepared at Jerusalem, is sold to superstitious pilgrims for genuine
balsam or extract of opobalsamum, although it does not possess
its qualities. Deception was also practised in Schiltberger’s time,
but he has shewn himself not to have been so great a simpleton
as the many who are being continually duped.</p>

<p>That the sale of balsam was a great source of revenue to the
sultan (the patriarch of Armenia paid a high price for it, see <a href="#Page_92">page
92</a>), is confirmed by others. Makrizi considered it a most useful
commodity. Christian sovereigns vied with each other in securing
a supply, and it was greatly esteemed by Christians in general,
because baptism was not considered efficacious unless oil of balsam
was dropped into the water prepared for the purpose.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(23<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) A plant called the balsam, from which oil was extracted,
and not to be found in any other part of the world, grew in the
vicinity of Fostat the chief city of Egypt, situated on the river
Nile to the north. So wrote Ibn Haukal in the 10th century. It
was near Fostat that Cairo was founded in 968. Jacques de Vitry,
a bishop in Palestine in the 13th century (afterwards bishop of
Tusculum, the modern Frascati) alludes to the produce of balsam
in Egypt, which previously was to be obtained in the Holy Land
only (<cite>Gesta Dei per Francos</cite>, etc., Hanoviæ, <span class="smcap">MDCXI</span>, <cite>Bongars edition</cite>).
According to De Lannoy, it grew by the shore near the city of
Cairo, and De Maillet, Consul for France at that city in the early
part of the last century, specially describes the plant, which, however,
he could not have seen, as it had disappeared two hundred
years before his time.</p>

<p>The last of the plants that grew in the garden of Matarea, says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>this author, were not more than two or three cubits in height,
the stem being about one inch in thickness; the leaves of a beautiful
green, on slender branches, resembled those of the rue. The
stem had a double bark, the outer of a reddish colour, the inner,
the thinnest, being perfectly green. The smell of the two barks
was not unlike that of the turpentine tree, but when bruised between
the fingers emitted an odour similar to that of cardamom.
Like the vine, this plant was primed annually, and De Maillet
supposes that then was extracted the valuable balsam so greatly
esteemed by all Christians, especially those of the Coptic church,
the efficacy of baptism without its application being generally
doubted (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Descr. de l’Egypte</cite>, edited by the Abbé Le Mascrier, à la
Haye, 1740). De Maillet distinguishes the balsam of Cairo from
that of Mecca, which Ali Bey (<cite>Travels</cite>, etc.) informs us was not
made there, but, on the contrary, was very scarce, as it could
only be obtained when brought by the Bedouins. Ali Bey was
told that it came from Medina. According to some authors, the
last of the balsam plants growing in Egypt were destroyed in
1615 by an inundation of the Nile.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_41" id="Footnote_1_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_41">(1.)</a>  “Of these four rivers I have seen three.”—Well versed as
Schiltberger was in the Holy Scriptures, he could not but have
been aware that the Euphrates and Tigris were included among
the four rivers that had their source in Paradise; but he substitutes
the Nile and Rison for the Gihon and Pison.</p>

<p>It is noticed elsewhere, that in the time of the Crusades the
Nile and Euphrates were mistaken for each other, in consequence
of the name by which a part of Cairo was known. When, after a
time, the error was discovered, the Indus was substituted for the
Euphrates, partly, perhaps, because Koush—Ethiopia—was confounded
with the country of the Cossæi, peopled, according to the
classic authors, by Ethiopians; and also because it had formerly
been mistaken for Κύσσια χώρα of the ancients, known to the
Hebrews as Eriz Koush, situated to the east of Babylon (Fürst,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span><cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. des Karäerth.</cite>, 102). Thus was it that Giovanni de’ Marignolli
(<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reis. in das Morgenl.</cite>, 18) who passed through China and
India soon after Marco Polo, mistook the Gihon of the Bible for
the Indus and the Nile. Even De Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 88)
does not venture to refute the opinion as to the continuity of these
two rivers. Being under the impression that the Nile was a continuation
of the Indus, Schiltberger calls the two rivers, which he
believed were united, the Nile, imagining that they were identical
with the Gihon or Sihon, a name that greatly resembles the
Hebrew denomination of the Nile.</p>

<p>“Rison” could scarcely have been other than the Pison of the
Bible, spelled Phison in the Nuremberg MS. (<cite>Penzel edition</cite>, 123);
this accounts for the statement that gold and precious stones were
found in it, produce for which the territory of Khivila, watered by
the Phison, was celebrated. Schiltberger adds, that the “Rison”
traversed India, whilst he identifies the Indus with the Nile; his
fourth river must therefore have been the Ganges, the Phison of
Moses of Chorene, who states that the river was at the limits of
the two peninsulas of India, although Haythoun, his countryman,
believed the Phison to be the Oxus because it divided Persia into
two parts: one containing Samarkand and Bokhara; the other,
the southern cities of Nishapur, Ispahan, etc. Not satisfied with
having reconciled the contradictory opinions of his predecessors,
in identifying the Phison with the Ganges, Giovanni de’ Marignolli
unites to these two rivers the Hoang-Ho and even the Volga
(Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>, etc., Appendix, vii), and he represents that,
after irrigating Evilach in India, the Phison passes, not only into
China, where it is called the Karamora (Kara-mouran—Black River—was
the name given by the Mongols to the Yellow River of the
Chinese), but after disappearing in the sands behind Caffa, again
shews itself and forms the Sea of Bakou—Caspian—behind Chana—Tana,
now Azoff. We are bound to admit that Schiltberger is
nearer the truth in saying that he had never seen the “Rison” at
all, than was the bishop of Bisignano who recognised it in too
many rivers at one and the same time.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_42" id="Footnote_1_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_42">(1.)</a>  “the city of Lambe, in a forest called Lambor.”—Pepper
was cultivated in Malabar, the country indicated by these two
names, long before Schiltberger’s time. Kazvini, who died in
1283, Aboulfeda and Ibn Batouta, all mention its produce, and
Giovanni de’ Marignolli, who visited Malabar in 1348, describes
the cultivation of pepper in pretty much the same terms as does
our author, equally refuting the story that the black colour was
owing to smoke employed to drive away serpents. We are informed
by this author of the existence of many Christians of St.
Thomas in the country, and that there was a Latin church dedicated
to St. George in the town of Columbus, doubtlessly the
Kollam of the Arabs (Peschel, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. Erdkunde</cite>, 162, note 3),
the Kuilon of the Chinese, called Coilum by Marco Polo, Chulam
by Benjamin of Tudela, Kaalan by Haythoun, Palombo, Alembo,
Polumbrum by Oderic and Mandevile, and Koulem by the natives.
These names have nothing in common with Koulouri, where the
Russian merchant Nikitin spent five months, but they somewhat
assimilate that of Colanum taken in 1503 by the Portuguese, who
stated that this town on the coast of Malabar was reputed to be
the most ancient and the richest in India (Maffei, <cite>Hist. Ind.</cite>, i,
52, xii, 289). Colanum may have been one of the places mentioned
by Schiltberger, the other being Calicut, touched at by
Vasco de Gama in 1498.</p>

<p>The colonisation of the Christian communities seen by the Portuguese
at the south-west extremity of the Deccan, dates from the
earliest centuries of our era. Neander says (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allg. Gesch. d. christlichen
Relig. und Kirche</cite>, <span class="smcap">I</span>, i, 114) that the Syriac-Persian community
on the coast of Malabar owes its origin to St. Thomas,
although its existence, according to Cosmas “Indicopleustes”, cannot
be traced earlier than the 6th century. Gregory of Nazianzus
asserts (<cite>Orat.</cite>, 25) that the Gospel was preached in India by the
apostle St. Thomas, who was murdered at a place near Madras
called Mailapur, on the Coromandel Coast, the Maabar of Marco
Polo, and identical with Mirapolis, where Giovanni de’ Marignolli
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>tells us the apostle was buried. We are scarcely encouraged
to look for the forest of “Lambor” in the province of Maabar, because
there happened to be indications of Christian churches,
rather than on the coast of Melibar or Malabar, where the produce
of pepper in ancient times is fully established.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) Friar Jordanus, 1333 (<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite>, 27), indignantly
denies that fire was placed under the pepper trees, and
is satisfied that the fruit turns black simply upon coming to
maturity. Oderic (Hakluyt <cite>Voyages</cite>, ii, 160), also a predecessor
of Schiltberger, repeats the statement that in the kingdom of
Minibar where pepper grows, fires are made with the object of
burning up the serpents, that the people might gather at the
harvest without injury to themselves. Oderic estimated the circuit
of the forest at an eighteen days’ journey, and the two cities
in it, not named by our author, he calls Flandrina and Cyncilim.
At the south end of the forest stood a city called Polumbrum,
noticed in the foregoing note, and at a distance of ten days’
journey was the kingdom of Mobar, where lay interred the body of
St. Thomas.</p>

<p>“It is seventeen hundred and forty years ago”, said the papa
or priest at Cacador to Buchanan in 1800, “since a certain saint
named Thomas introduced the Nazareens; he landed at Meliapura,
and took up his residence on a hill near Madras, now called
after his name” (<cite>Journey from Madras</cite>, London, 1807). There
he performed a miracle annually, says another authority, until
English heretics came into the neighbourhood. St. Thomas afterwards
made a voyage to Cochin, and near that place established a
church which became the metropolitan; he returned to Meliapura
and there died, or, according to others, was put to death.
It appears that a bishop of India was present at the Council of
Nice, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 325, and in the following century the Christians on the
coast of Malabar received the accession of a bishop of Antioch,
who was accompanied by a small party of Syrians. That Christians
in Malabar were numerous at the time Schiltberger obtained
his information is most probable, because Portuguese historians
relate that in the year 1503 they possessed upwards of one hundred
churches, those in the interior refusing to conform to Rome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>(Assemanus, <cite>Bibliot. Orient.</cite>, iv, 391 <i>et seq.</i>; M. Geddes, <cite>The Hist.

scarcely be a doubt that this was the lemon, called nimbouka in
Sanscrit; neemon, leemon in Hindostani, and lemonn by the
Arabs, a fruit with which Schiltberger could scarcely have been
familiar in his own country, or in those parts of Asia Minor, Central
Asia, and even Egypt, through which he travelled. The lemon,
brought from India by the Arabs about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 912, was first planted
at Oman; then at Basra in Irak; afterwards in Syria, where the
plant became common, whence it was introduced into Palestine
and Egypt. Jacques de Vitry includes the lemon tree with others
he saw for the first time when in the Holy Land in the 13th century:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sunt ibi speciales arbores tam fructiferæ quam steriles</span>”
(<cite>Gesta Dei per Francos</cite>, etc., lxxxvi); from which it might almost
be inferred that the Crusaders, who are supposed to have introduced
this plant into Europe, did not do so until after Jacques de Vitry
wrote. The genus, however, could not have been entirely unknown
in the West, it being recorded in <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chronica Montis Cassiniensis,
Pertz Scr.</cite>, 7, 652, that when the prince of Salerno in the
year 1000 (1016?) was besieged by the Arabs, forty Norman
knights who passed that way on their homeward journey from the
Holy Land, delivered him. Upon taking their leave, the knights
were accompanied by ambassadors from the prince, who were bearers
of presents of the “poma cedrina (citrina?), amigdalas quoque et
deauratas nuces”, and a message to the Norman people, inviting
them to come to so beautiful a country and help him to defend it
(Abd-Allatif, S. de Sacy edition, 115–117; Makrizi in Quatremère;
<cite>Journ. Horticultural Society</cite>, ix, 1855; Risso et Poiteau, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. et
Culture des Orangers</cite>, Paris, 1872; Hehn, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kulturpflanzen und
Hausthiere in ihrem Uebergang aus Asien nach Griechenl. und

<p>Lemon-juice was employed at Ceylon as protection against the
numberless land-leeches that seized upon the bare legs of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>natives in the lowlands (Ibn Batouta, <cite>Lee edition</cite>, 188; Knox,
<cite>Hist. of Ceylon</cite>, etc., <span class="smcap">I</span>, iv, 49), precisely the sort of country where
the vine pepper—Piper nigrum—grows to best advantage, viz., on
level ground along the banks of rivers and rivulets (Simmonds,
<cite>Tropl. Agriculture</cite>, 476). In his notice on “Sylan”, Friar Oderic
says that the people who dive into a lake infested with horse-leeches,
for the purpose of recovering precious stones, “take lemons,
which they peel, anointing themselves thoroughly with the juice
thereof, that so they may dive naked under the water, the horse-leeches
not being able to hurt them” (Hakluyt <cite>Voyages</cite>, ii, 160).
Sir Emerson Tennent quotes Oderic, and distinguishes the land- from the cattle-leech.
The former, so inimical to man, never
visits ponds or streams, but is found in the lower ranges of hill
country kept damp by frequent showers; it attains a length of
two inches (<cite>Natural History of Ceylon</cite>, Chap. xiii). There is
strange confusion, in associating the use to which the lemon is
put, in Ceylon, with the pepper-growing country of Malabar by no
means famous for leeches.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

(<cite>d. Ital. Handelscolon.</cite>, etc., in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift f. d. gesammte

the several Italian Powers, the Venetians and Genoese were at
that time the most interested in trade with Alexandria. Their
predecessors the Pisans, who had taken an active part in the
eastern trade, were forced at the commencement of the 15th
century to abandon their interests in favour of the Florentines,
and in great measure also of the Anconitans, Neapolitans, and
citizens of Gaeta; but the Catalans, equally with the Italians,
kept up extensive commercial relations with Egypt.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>De Lannoy (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. et Ambass.</cite>, 70) records that the allied forces
landed near the old port, the entrance to which was ever afterwards
closed against all vessels of Christian nationalities. Upon
the approach of the Egyptians on the above occasion, the Franks
re-embarked after having pillaged the city and carried off five
thousand captives (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, iv, 512). This expedition,
in which twenty-four Venetian, two Genoese, ten Rhodian,
five French, and several Cyprian vessels took part, was completed
in the space of a week, so that allowing the requisite time for landing
and re-embarking, the occupation of the city would most probably
have lasted three days, the period indicated by Schiltberger.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_43" id="Footnote_3_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_43">(3.)</a>  “took Alexandria, and remained in it three days.”—This
tower must have been either the pharos of Alexandria, or some
tower on the islet that had become united to the mainland by the
sands of the Nile; otherwise, De Lannoy, to whom we are indebted
for a detailed description of the port of Alexandria under a
strategic point of view, would not have failed to notice it. He
simply mentions a long spit, one mile wide, between the old and
new ports which both reached to the walls of the city. This islet
is now occupied by one of its finest quarters.</p>

<p>Makrizi describes the pharos at Alexandria (S. de Sacy, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chrestom.
Arabe</cite>, ii, 189) as having at the top a large mirror, around which
criers were seated. Upon perceiving the approach of an enemy
through the agency of this reflector, they gave warning to those
in the immediate neighbourhood by loud cries, and flags were
displayed to apprise others at a distance, so that people in all
parts of the city were immediately on the alert.</p>

<p>De Sacy (Abd-Allatif, 239) is of opinion that the large circles
employed in astronomical observations and which were placed on
the highest part of such lofty buildings as the pharos, may have
led Arabian writers, who usually delighted in the relation of all
that was marvellous, to represent that the mirror at the top of
the Alexandria lighthouse was placed there for better observing
the departure of Greek vessels from their ports. The tower
described in the text was no doubt designed for this purpose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>because Ijas an Arabian author (Weil. <i>l.&nbsp;c.</i>, v, 358) relates, that
in 1472 the sultan Kaïtbaï caused a new lighthouse to be constructed
near the old one; it communicated with the city by
means of a dyke, and was provided with a chapel, a mill, and a
bakehouse; also a platform from which strange vessels could be
seen at the distance of a day’s sail, so that time was afforded for
preparing the guns with which the tower was supplied, to resist
their approach. Schiltberger was right in saying that there was
a temple in the tower, because Abd-Allatif speaks of a mosque as
being at the top of the pharos at Alexandria.</p>

<p>Apart from the possibility of there having been a traitor
amongst them who ministered in that temple, the Egyptians may
have invented the tale narrated in this chapter, in extenuation of
their negligence in suffering themselves to be taken by surprise
by the Crusaders.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_44" id="Footnote_1_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_44">(1.)</a>  “had I not seen it, I would not have spoken or written
about it.”—I do not think I can be far out in attributing this
gigantic bone to Alexander of Macedon, not only because “Allenklaisser”
is so like the Arabic name Al Iskender, but also because
the remembrance of the rapidity with which the founder of
Alexandria had carried his conquests in the East, could not have
been obliterated in the city which was indebted to him, for having
become the central depot of the commerce of the world during
upwards of one thousand years. There can be no manner of
doubt that, in the course of ages, other ancient traditions became
mixed up with legends of Alexander, especially as regards the
Jews, who were treated by the great conqueror with the urbanity
that some rulers of the earth, of our own times, would do well to
imitate.</p>

<p>We read in Abd-el-Hakam’s history of the conquest of Egypt
(Makrizi by Quatremère, <span class="smcap">I</span>, i, 218), that the body of a giant killed by
Moses fell across the Nile and served as a bridge. With this legend
may be associated Schiltberger’s tale, and his credulity need not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>wondered at when we consider, that in the 13th century the story
was thought worthy of being related; and some there were even
bold enough to tell it to the powerful ruler of the Golden Horde,
Bereke Khan, who enquired of the ambassadors sent to him in
1263 by the sultan Bibars, whether it was true that the bone of a
giant, laid across the Nile, was being used as a bridge! The
ambassadors, who had been probably selected from among the
most enlightened of the sultan’s ministers, replied that they had
never seen it, an answer that may have been elicited by the nature
of the question, because the strange bridge seen by Schiltberger
must have been in Arabia and not in Egypt. It united two rocks
separated by a profound ravine in the depths of which coursed a
torrent, and as it afforded the only practicable means for crossing
the ravine on the high road, travellers were obliged to pass
over it.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that these topographic details were invented
by Schiltberger, and am therefore inclined to think that he alludes
to the neighbourhood of the fortresses of Kerak and Shaubek,
places that acquired considerable importance during the Crusades
in consequence of their admirable situations. They are easily
identified with “Crach” and “Sebach” mentioned by De Lannoy,
after he refers to the “montaignes d’Arrabicq” for the purpose of
observing, that in the former was “la pierre du desert”, and in the
latter the sepulchre of Aaron, and that the road thence conducted
through a desert to St. Catherine and to Mecca. Quatremère
says (Makrizi, <span class="smcap">II</span>, i, 249) that Karac was the key to the road
across the desert. Caravans to and from Damascus and Mecca,
merchants, and troops despatched from the capital of Syria to
that of Egypt, were obliged to pass close under its walls or at no
great distance from them.</p>

<p>Shaubek, the “Mons regalis” of the Crusaders, thirty-six miles
from Kerak, was also a strong place. Burckhardt tells us that a
ravine, three hundred feet in depth, encircles the citadel, which is
in a better state of preservation than the one at Kerak or Krak,
called also Petra deserti from its proximity to the ancient city of
that name, and to which a part of Arabia owes the name of Arabia
Petrea; its situation is characteristically described by Pliny:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>“oppidum circumdatum montibus inaccessis, amne interfluente”.
The valley in which this ancient city was situated, the “vallis
Moysi” of the Crusaders, now Wady Mousa (Raumer, <cite>Palæstina</cite>,
etc., 271–277), five hundred feet in depth, is watered by a stream
and surrounded by steep rocks (Laborde, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voy. dans l’Arabie
pétrée</cite>, 55).</p>

<p>According to an Arabian author quoted by Quatremère (<i>l. c.</i> <span class="smcap">II</span>,
i, 245), the road near these two cities was so peculiar that it could
have been held by one man against a hundred horsemen. Another
reason for the supposition that the bridge seen by Schiltberger
was in one of these passages, lies in the fact that the same writer
includes the tomb of Iskender among the holy places of pilgrimage
in this ancient country; but he does not determine the individuality
of that Iskender.</p>

<p>On the hypothesis that “Allenklaisser’s” limb was near the
tomb of Iskender, I should be inclined to look in the same locality
for the bridge that was constructed, according to the inscription
it bore, two hundred years before Schiltberger saw it. Judging
from other passages in his work, the author was in Egypt probably
about the year 1423, the date of the construction of the bridge
being therefore 1223; this, however, can scarcely have been the
case, because the feuds between Saladin’s successors, which commenced
soon after his death in 1193, had not ceased, and the
Ayoubites were continually in conflict with the Crusaders. It
should be borne in mind that although Schiltberger knew that the
year 825 of the Hegira corresponded to <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1423, he may not
have been aware that the Mahomedan is shorter than the
Christian year, whereby 200 Mahomedan years are equal to 193
solar years only; and thus he calculated that the construction of
the bridge took place in 1223 instead of 1230. This was the
time when Al-Kamyl the nephew of Saladin, having become
reconciled with the emperor Frederick II., was recognised by the
princes of his house as their suzerain lord, and he thereafter, until
his death in 1238, held Syria and Egypt, with the exception of
the fortresses of Kerak and Shaubek which he had to cede in
1229 to his nephew Daud or David. This circumstance, no doubt,
induced the “king-sultan” to order the construction of a bridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>for keeping up communication between two parts of his kingdom,
the new bridge being near the old one that was kept smeared with
oil, a condition that had the effect of persuading the guileless
Bavarian that it was indeed a gigantic bone.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

Neumann supposes, a Molla or Mussulman priest is here implied, I
would venture to suggest that allusion is made to Hassan, founder
of the sect of Assassins or Mulahidah. The partisans of “the
Old Man of the Mountain” had not been entirely exterminated
by the Mongols, for not only were they in Asia after Marco Polo,
but they reappeared in India at a later period, where the Bohras,
another Ismailis sect, existed, and with whom they have been
frequently confounded. “The nature of their doctrine indeed”,
says Colonel Yule (Marco Polo, i, 154), “seems to be very much
alike, and the Bohras like the Ismailis attach a divine character
to their <em>Mullah</em> or chief pontiff, and make a pilgrimage to his
presence once in life”.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_46" id="Footnote_1_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_46">(1.)</a>  “thy descendants will also acquire great power.”—It is
stated in chapter 56 that Mahomet was born in the year of our
Lord 609, so that his journey into Egypt took place in 622, the
year of the prophet’s flight from Mecca to Medina. Schiltberger
evidently confuses that memorable event with a journey undertaken
by Mahomet when in his thirteenth year, if not into Egypt,
at least into Chaldæa, where his great destiny was foretold to him
by a Nestorian priest. It is most probable, however, that the
author was not quite familiar with Mahomedan traditions, which
assert that it was in the year 609, that is to say, thirteen years
before the date of the Hegira, that Mahomet was informed of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>lofty calling by an angel, and that the archangel Gabriel quickly
taught him to read; it is therefore the existence of the prophet,
not the birth of the man, that dates from this year. The error is
very pardonable, because several miracles attributed to the prophet
by Mussulmans, were supposed to have been performed in his
youth. They believe, for instance, that from his infancy he was
enclosed within an aureola, and could therefore stand in the light
of the sun without casting a shadow, which would also have been
the case had a black cloud floated over his head as related by
Schiltberger, who remained too firmly attached to Christianity
not to attribute the phenomenon to the wiles of the Prince of
Darkness, rather than to the effect of celestial light.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) What appears to be the more generally accepted story of
Mahomet’s first journey from home, is related by Syer Ameer Ali,
in <cite>A Critical examination of the Life and Teachings of Mohammed</cite>;
London, 1873. When Abu Taleb (the prophet’s uncle, for he was
an orphan) determined upon making a journey to Syria, leaving
Mohammed with his own children, and was on the point of mounting
his camel, the boy clasped his knees and cried: Oh! my uncle,
take me with thee! The heart of Abu Taleb melted within him,
and the little orphan nephew joined the commercial expedition of
his uncle. They travelled together into Syria. During one of
the halts they met an Arab monk, who, struck by the signs of
future greatness, and intellectual and moral qualities of the
highest type in the countenance of the orphan child of Abdullah,
recognised in him the liberator and saviour of his country and
people.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

the third, Amarat.”—The designations of these several edifices and
their uses are correct. The jamy, called “Sam”, is the largest of
mosques; “Mesgit”, or rather mesjyd, being an ordinary and
smaller mosque. “Medrassa”, for medressè, is a college usually
attached to a mosque, and to be distinguished from the mehteb or
boy’s school; and “Amarat”, for which we should read imaret, is
an imperial place of burial, and a name applied also to a hospital,
almshouse, etc.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_47" id="Footnote_1_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_47">(1.)</a>  “Of the Infidel’s Easter-day.”—This is the first of the two
Baïrams, the only religious festivals of the Mahomedans. The
first, called Id Fitr—feast of the termination of the fast—falls on
the first day of the month of Chewal, immediately after the feast
of Ramadan. The second, called Id Addha, or Kourban Baïram—feast
of sacrifice—is celebrated seventy days later, on the tenth
day of the month of Zilhidshek. Id indicates the anniversary of
these periodical feasts, which take place in their turn every season
during the space of thirty-three years, according to the lunar
months of the Mahomedan calendar. The first festival is of one
day’s duration only, but it is usually observed for three days.
The second, instituted in remembrance of Abraham’s sacrifice, is
continued for four days. Mussulmans celebrate it by proceeding
on a pilgrimage to Mecca, where is the Kaaba or sanctuary, constructed,
it is said, by Abraham and his son Ishmael, in the form
of the tent or tabernacle that was placed there by angels the day
the world was created.</p>

<p>The ancient custom of covering the Kaaba, at this festival, with
a black cloth, is still observed, the old cloth being cut up and
sold to pilgrims, who preserve the pieces as the most precious of
relics.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_51" id="Footnote_1_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_51">(1.)</a>  “Those who are in this fellowship are called They.”—To
those who are unfamiliar with the name, says Neumann, the title
of Ghasi would scarcely be recognised in that of They. Neumann
misunderstands Schiltberger, who does not at all allude to the
Ghasi, but to those of the Malahidah sect called Day (Missionaries),
and whom he designates They, just as his own countrymen at
times employ the word Teutsche for Deutsche. There certainly
were Malahidahs in Asia Minor, or Turkey, as the author called
that territory.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_52" id="Footnote_1_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_52">(1.)</a>  “Machmet is his true messenger.”—This invocation in
Arabic, in general use among Mussulmans, reads thus: La Illaha
illa Allah!—No Gods, but God!—Illaha being the plural of Allah—God—and
La, the simple negative, No, in opposition to Yes.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_52" id="Footnote_2_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_52">(2.)</a>  “Machmet his chief messenger.”—The correct rendering
of this passage would be: T’hary byr dour, Messyh kyoull dour,
Meryam kara bash dour, M’hammed ressouly dour—God is one,
the Messiah is his slave, Mary is a blackhead, Mahomet is his
apostle. Mary is here termed a blackhead to signify a slave,
because coloured females were employed as slaves, white women
being reserved for other purposes. This formula, though no
longer obligatory, would still be employed in the Mahomedan
provinces of the Caucasus and in Persia, were a Christian to
embrace Mahomedanism. The words imply a renunciation of
Christianity, as also a recognition that God is One and Mahomet
is his apostle.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_56" id="Footnote_1_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_56">(1.)</a>  “the Winden tongue, which they call Arnaw.”—Schiltberger
was not wrong in saying that the Venede tongue was
known to the Turks as the Arnaut; at least it appears in Pianzola
(<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Grammatica</em>, <em lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dizionario</em>, etc.) that the country called by the
Italians, Illirice, was identical with the Slavonia of the Greeks and
the Arnaut of the Turks. This is no place for solving the question,
why the Turks should have designated two people of different
origin by the same name; but the circumstance serves to support
the opinion of several authors (Köppen, <cite>Krymsky Sbornyk</cite>, 1837,
226) that the Turks were not in the habit of calling people of any
distinct nationality by the name of Arnaut, but rather all those
who, being the subjects or brothers-in-arms of the Arianite family,
had distinguished themselves in their struggles with them; such,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>for instance, as the Slaves and Albanians or Skipetars, among
whom was George Castriota of Slave descent (Jirecek, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d.
Bulgaren</cite>, 268). His biographer (Barletius, <cite>Vita Scanderbegi</cite>, etc.,
apud Zinkeisen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d. O. R.</cite>, i, 776) thus expresses himself in
allusion to Topia, the compatriot of the Scanderbeg of the Turks.
“Hic est ille Arianites qui apud Macedones (Slaves) et Epirotas
(Albanians) cognomento Magnus et dictus et habitus est”, ...

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_56" id="Footnote_2_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_56">(2.)</a>  “the Yassen tongue, which the Infidels call Afs.”—The As,
Yasses—the Alains, Alans of antiquity, are the Ossets of to-day, a
people inhabiting a strip of territory in the middle of the great
mountain range of the Caucasus, and who are believed to be the
only connecting link between the Indo-Persian branch and the
European branch of the great Indo-Germanic race. The population
in 1873 was estimated at 65,000, of which number, it was
supposed, 50,000 were Christians; the remainder being Mahomedans
and Pagans, or a mingling of the three (<cite>The Crimea and
Transc.</cite>, i, 296, ii, 2).</p>

<p>An unpretending sketch of this interesting people, twice alluded
to by the author (in chapter 61 he speaks of them as the Jassen
and Affs), is here submitted.</p>

<p>The earliest mention of the Alans is made by Josephus (<cite>Wars</cite>,
VII, vii, 4), and again by Procopius (<cite>De Bell. Goth.</cite>, iv, 3, 4),
from whom we learn that they dwelt on the shores of the Lake
Mæotis and to the North of the Caucasus, whence they overran
the country of the Medes and of Armenia, until defeated by
Artaces who forced them to withdraw beyond the Cyrus; similar
predatory incursions into Tauric-Scythia and the West, being
arrested by the Goths, who in their turn were overpowered by the
Huns. The invasion of Asia Minor by the Alans gave cause of
uneasiness to the Roman Empire, but it was successfully resisted
by Arrian, prefect of Cappadocia (Forbiger, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Handbuch der Alt.
Geogr.</cite>, i, 424), and they were also defeated by Vakhtang “Gourgasal”—Wolf
Lion—the sovereign of Georgia, 466–499, upon their
venturing to invade that kingdom (Brosset, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de la Géorgie</cite>,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, 153). In 966, the Yasses were subdued by the Russians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>under Sviatoslaff, after his conquest of Tmoutorakan (Taman);
and in 1276 they lost Dediakoff, their capital, to the Mongols,
whose progress, having the Kiptchaks for their allies, they
attempted to oppose (Karamsin, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de Russie</cite>, i, 214; ii, 191).
After this we find the Yasses in the West, for when Tchaga, the son
of Nogaï, led an expedition sent by the Khan Toula Boga, 1287–1291,
to the Danube, he halted for a while in the country of the
Ass, now Moldavia, the capital of which bears their name to this
day—Yassy (D’Ohsson, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. des Mongols</cite>, iv, note p. 750). After
the death of Nogaï, 1299, at Kaganlik (now Kouïalnyk near
Odessa), some 16,000 Ass or Alains, more than one half of which
number were fighting men, crossed the river, 1301, and offered
their services to the Byzantine Emperor by whom they were
accepted (Pachymeres, <cite>Migne edition</cite>, tom. 144, p. 337).</p>

<p>Alains were met in Khozary (Crimea) by the ambassadors of
Bibars I., sultan of Egypt, 1260–1270 (Makrizi by Quatremère, <span class="smcap">I</span>, i,
213, 218); a statement confirmed by Aboulfeda who says they
occupied Kyrkyer, now Tchyfout Kaleh—Jew’s Fortress (see <a href="#Footnote_8_36">note
8</a>, p. 176, for this name), close to which is Baghtchasaraï the modern
Tatar capital in the peninsula; also by Marino Sanudo the Venetian
traveller, who wrote, 1333, that there still were in the country
“Gothi et aliqui Alani” (Kunstmann, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Stud. über M. S.</cite>, 105).</p>

<p>The Alains should be included amongst those populations in
the East that were converted to Christianity through the exertions
of Justinian; but they relapsed to paganism until a priesthood
was settled in their country by Thamar, the great queen of
Georgia, 1174–1201, who caused numerous churches to be constructed
for their use; and that they belonged to the Greek
Church, as stated by Schiltberger, is shewn by Rubruquis the
Gray Friar, for he met at Scacatay some Alans or Aas, “as they
were called by the Tartars”, who professed the Greek faith, and
with whom he offered up prayers for the dead (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil de Voy. et
de Mém.</cite>, iv, 243, 246, <i>et seq.</i>)—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

Abyssinia, and other parts. His followers, known as Jacobites,
believe that in the Saviour of the World, both natures are united
in one, and herein lies the principal difference from the Greek
Church. Although their vernacular is the Arabic, the Syrian
Christians employ the Syrian language in public worship (Mosheim,

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_57" id="Footnote_1_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_57">(1.)</a>  “Pera, which the Greeks call Kalathan, and the Infidels
call it the same.”—The Genoese were already established at
Constantinople when Manuel I. ascended the throne (1143). Besides
the emporium of Copario in the city of Constantinople, they
possessed Orcu in the suburb of Galata (Heyd, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Colonie Commer.</cite>,
etc., i, 330; Desimone, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">I Genovesi</cite>, etc., 217 <i>et seq.</i>), which
they occupied during the reign of the Angelos dynasty, remaining
there so long as the Latin Empire lasted, but without ever successfully
rivalling the Venetians. After the restoration of the Greek
Empire at Constantinople by Michel VIII. in 1261, their fortunes
changed in consequence of the great privileges that were accorded to
them by the emperor, which included the cession of the suburb of
Galata, soon to become the central depôt of all their settlements
in Greece, on the shores of the Black Sea and of the Sea of Azoff,
a transfer which probably accounts for the appearance of “Mæotis
palus, nunc Galatia”, in the list of new names supplied by Codinus
(<cite>Hieroclis Synecdemus</cite>, etc., 313).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rivalry of the Venetians, who in 1296 even
seized upon Galata, or Pera as the colony was usually called
by the Latins, and their frequent quarrels with the Greeks, the
commercial prosperity of the Genoese settlement went on increasing
until about the middle of the 14th century, when the
Customs dues amounted to 200,000 hyperperes, those at Constantinople
scarcely reaching the sum of 30,000 hyperperes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>(<i>Niceph. Greg.</i>, ii, 842). This “State within a State”, no doubt
excited the cupidity of the Turks after their assumption of power
in Europe, and the removal of the sultan’s residence to Adrianople;
but the Genoese succeeded for a time in averting the threatening
danger by making numerous concessions, as appears by the treaty
of commerce concluded by them in 1387 with Murad I., whose
successor, Bajazet, lay siege to Constantinople. This monarch,
however, was constrained to turn his arms against Timour, and
the capital was spared the horrors of a longer siege. The battle
of Angora, so fatal to the Ottoman power, delayed for a few
decades only the fall of the Greek Empire and the disappearance
of the Genoese.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

his successors, believed they found beneath the surface of the

<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Description de l’Asie Mineur</cite>, 489:—“Dès que l’on accepte le
plateau de Bounar-Bachi” (a name, says this author, derived from
two sources of the Scamander) “comme l’emplacement de la Troie
homérique, les indications circonstanciées et si nombreuses que
fournit le Poète sur les localités environnantes, viennent s’adapter
d’elles-mêmes an terrain actuel.”

“Une ville de fondation éolienne qui usurpe le nom d’Ilion, et
qui par la suite des temps et d’obscurité des traditions, prétendit
occuper l’emplacement même de la cité de Priam, s’était élevée
sur une autre éminence éloignée d’une lieue vers le Nord, et située
non plus sur la gauche, mais sur la rive droite du Simoïs. Cette
ville est l’Ilium des siècles postérieurs, l’Ilium Recens; et lorsque
les poètes ou les historiens de l’époque romaine parlent du berceau
de leur race, c’est toujours à cette Ilium éolienne qu’il faut rapporter
leurs allusions et leurs descriptions, car le site réel de
l’Ilium primitive était dès lors oublié. La nouvelle Ilium est
maintenant ruinée, comme l’Ilium homérique; près de l’éminence
isolée qu’elle occupa, on trouve aujourd’hui le village Turc de
Tchiblak.”</p>

<p>The ruins near the sea and at no great distance from Constantinople,
believed by Schiltberger to have been those of the royal
city, must have been the remains of Alexandria Troas opposite the
island of Tenedos. It was there that the Russian pilgrim Daniel,
and the author’s contemporaries, the archdeacon Zosimus and
Clavijo, thought they saw the ruins of Troy, as was the case one
hundred years later, 1547, with the French traveller Belon, who
landed that he might examine them with the greater facility. At
the base of a small hillock, but within the circuit of the walls of
the city, were some ancient arches and the remains of two palaces
in marble (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Obs. de plusieurs singularités trouvées en Grèce, en Asie</cite>,
etc.; in Saint-Martin, ii, 8). Belon passes lightly over the difficulty
he experienced in not finding near this, the supposed site of
the Homeric city, the two rivers Simoïs and Xanthus.</p>

<p>The honorary president of the Geographical Society at Paris has
lately sought to prove, that the city of Priam should be looked for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>where Lechevalier conceived it to be, that is to say, at Bunarbashí,
whence Dr. Schliemann believes he is justified in removing it to
the neighbourhood of Ilium Recens or Hissarlik, as the result of
the successful explorations conducted by himself with the assistance
of his wife. Although some English and most German authorities
applaud the zeal with which his work was performed, and the
great importance of his discoveries to students of archæology, all
are not so readily persuaded that the question of the position of
Ilium is solved, seeing that the topographical details, as we receive
them from Homer, are drawn from the imagination of the poet,
rather than after the reality.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_57" id="Footnote_4_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_57">(4.)</a>  “for all [kinds of] pastime that might be desired in front
of the palace.”—The games, chiefly of Eastern origin, that were
held in the open space in front of the imperial residence, are
mentioned by various authors. It will here suffice to quote from
the writings of a predecessor of Schiltberger, and of one who
followed after him.</p>

<p>When Edrisi visited Constantinople, circa 1161, sports were
held in the hippodrome, which he considered the most marvellous
in the universe. It had to be passed before reaching the palace,
an edifice unequalled in its proportions and in the beauty of its construction
(<cite>Jaubert edition</cite>, 297). Bertrandon de la Brocquière, 1432
(<cite>Early Travels in Palestine</cite>, Bohn edition, 1848), thus describes one
of the sports he witnessed in the large and handsome square in
front of St. Sophia: “I saw the brother of the emperor, the despot
of the Morea, exercise himself with a score of other horsemen.
Each had a bow, and they gallopped along the enclosure throwing
their hats before them, which, when they had passed, they shot at;
and he who with his arrow pierced the hat or was nearest to it,
was esteemed the most expert.”—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_57" id="Footnote_5_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_57">(5.)</a> “he has no longer that power, so the apple has disappeared.”—Stephen
of Novgorod (<cite>Pout. Rouss. loud.</cite>, ii, 14), a
pilgrim passing through Constantinople about the year 1350,
certifies that the emperor held in his hand a kind of golden
apple surmounted by a cross. Clavijo says the “pella redonda
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>dorada” was in its place, and so, we may conclude, was the cross;
because in 1420, Zosimus (<cite>Pout. Rouss. loud.</cite>, ii, 38) saw the cross on
the apple that was in the emperor’s hand; it is probable, therefore,
that these insignias were removed between the years 1420–1427, at
which latter date Schiltberger spent some months at Constantinople
after his escape from bondage.</p>

<p>A short time before the author’s arrival in the city of the
Cæsars, the aged Manuel died (1425), and John, his son and successor,
was forced to sign a treaty of peace with the Turks, the
conditions being of the most onerous nature; for he was deprived
of all his possessions with the exception of the capital,
the appanages in the Morea of the Greek princes, and a few
fortresses on the shores of the Black Sea (Zinkeisen, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. d.
O. R.</cite>, i, 533); he also covenanted to pay the sultan an annual
tribute of 300,000 aspres, and to make him numerous presents
of great value as a mark of personal regard. In such circumstances
the unfortunate monarch must have been under the
necessity of laying hands upon all the gold he could come across,
and Schiltberger’s <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</em> on the disappearance of the apple
together with the emperor’s power, might be taken literally.</p>

<p>Zosimus relates that the statue which held the apple was distant
an arrow’s flight from the hippodrome, doubtlessly the “fine square
for tilting”, now known as the Meïdan. The magnificent palace
wherein receptions were held, and that excited the admiration of
Schiltberger, must have been the Boukoleon and Daphna which
adjoined the hippodrome (Dethier, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Bosphor und Constantinopel</cite>,
Wien, 1873, 22). This edifice was greatly neglected during the
reigns of the last of the Palæologi, and after his conquest of Constantinople,
Mahomet II. ordered its complete destruction.</p>

<p>The other palace noticed was the Blackernes, in which Clavijo
(<cite>Hakluyt Soc. Publ.</cite> 29) was received by the emperor Manuel.
Near it, Bertrandon de la Brocquière found a “fausse braie d’un
bon et haut mur en avant du fossé, qui était en glacis excepté dans
un espace de deux cents pas à l’une de ses extrémités près du
palais”. This must have been the place where Schiltberger saw a
“getüll.”<a name="FNanchor_5_57a" id="FNanchor_5_57a"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_57a" class="fnanchor">1</a>—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>(5<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) The statement that the statue was placed on a pillar is
corroborated by Cedrenus in his Chronicles, and in the Annals of
Zonaras, in which works we find it stated that the great pillar
Augusteon was erected in the fifteenth year of the reign of
Justinian, the statue being placed on it two years later. When
Bertrandon de la Brocquière saw the equestrian statue, which he
inadvertently calls that of Constantine, it grasped a sceptre in the
left hand. Pierre Gilles, the naturalist and author, sent to the
Levant by Francis I. of France, found portions of this statue in the
melting house where ordnance were cast, it having been overturned
and destroyed in 1523 (<cite>Antiquities of Constantinople</cite>, London,
1729); or in 1525, according to the anonymous author of the
Constantiniade. The proportions were colossal, for the leg exceeded
the height of a man, and the nose was nine inches in length, as
were also the hoofs of the horse. Gilles represents that the
statue, which was made of brass, faced the East, as if the emperor
was marching against the Persians; the right arm was stretched
out, and in the left hand was a globe to signify universal power
over the whole world, all success in war being attributed to the
cross fixed on the top. He was dressed like Achilles, in a coat of
mail and shining helmet.</p>

<p>It is certain that the globe and cross disappeared fully one
hundred years before the arrival at Constantinople of Gilles, whose
detailed description of the statue must have reference to its
original condition.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

the clouds.”—French and Italian names commencing with a vowel,
commonly became transformed by the addition of the article which
preceded them, and in this way, Imbro was altered during the
Latin empire to Lembro, the name ordinarily given to the island,
whence “Lemprie”, and Nembro of Clavijo. During a part of
the 15th century, Imbros belonged to the Gattilusio, a Genoese
family, and in 1430 became subject to the Greek emperor. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>island is overspread with the ruins of many castles, the walls of
which are covered with inscriptions and armorial bearings (Heyd,

<p>(1<span class="smcap lowercase">A.</span>) The author’s statement may be taken as being the
reverse of the fact, and that the clouds had descended to the
mountain, for the highest point of land on the island of Imbros is
only 1959 feet, an altitude altogether insignificant when compared
to the mountains he must have seen in his journeys; they include
the great range of the Caucasus, shewing summits at upwards of
18,000 feet, and the noble Ararat, rising nearly 15,000 feet above
the plains of the Araxes. Had his course lay further to the
west, Samothraky, at 5248 feet above the sea, would have excited
his imagination still more.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

to the present dome constructed soon after 559, the thirty-second
year of the reign of Justinian.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

After the battle of Nicopolis, Bajazet renewed the siege of Constantinople,
the city being succoured by a force of 1200 men sent
by Charles VI. of France, and bodies of troops from Genoa,
Venice, Rhodes, and Lesbos. Marshal Boucicault withstood the
siege with his little army, and on quitting the capital in 1399, the
command devolved upon Chateaumorant, the emperor Manuel
being absent in France, whither he had gone to ask for assistance.
It was fortunate for the Greeks that Bajazet was obliged to muster
the whole of his forces to enable him to encounter Timour’s
legions.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

es an der selben stat ein getüll hat.” The identical word “getüll”
appears in the editions of 1475 (?) and 1549, but is altogether
omitted by Penzel, and remains unexplained by Neumann. Professor
Bruun (Russian edition) interprets it as palisade; I
prefer, however, to translate it as breakwater, believing that I
recognise in the locality described by Schiltberger that part of the
city on the Sea of Marmora, between the Eptapyrgyon—Seven
Towers—and the Acropolis, abreast of which huge stones were
placed to resist the force of the waves (Cantacuzene, <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist. de
l’Empire d’Orient</cite>). An earlier author (Glycas, <cite>Annales</cite>) states
that they were conveyed thither for the construction of the fortifications.
At any rate it is a fact, that the Admiralty chart
shows what appears to be a submerged reef close inshore in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>fathom and a half of water, about one half mile to the westward

member of the Greek clergy is buried in complete ecclesiastical
attire, but the ancient custom of interring in a sitting posture,
was and is still observed in the case of a bishop only.</p>

<p>In a recent account of the obsequies at Constantinople of a
bishop of the Greek Church (<cite>The Times</cite>, August 29, 1878), the
Correspondent writes: “I was ushered into a small densely
crowded church, and on walking forward a few steps, found
myself confronted by an aged and venerable prelate, seated on a
throne in full canonicals, richly decorated with gold and jewels.
He sat perfectly motionless, with his eyes closed, and holding in
his right hand a jewelled rod resembling a sceptre. Two or three
people advanced and devoutly kissed his hand, but he did not
return the customary benediction, and gave no sign of consciousness.
‘Is he asleep?’ I whispered inquiringly to my friend.
‘No, he is dead; that is the late patriarch’.”</p>

<p>Ἅγιος ὁ Θεός is called the Τρισάγιον, as being emblematic of the
Holy Trinity. It is not sung in the Greek Church. Κύριε ἐλέησον
is the response of the people to a prayer repeated by the
priest during the service; and it is quite true that Χριστὲ ἐλέησον
is never said in Greek churches.</p>

<p>It is still the custom to kiss the priest’s right hand, at the
same time saying, Εὐλόγησον, Δέσποτα!—Thy blessing, Your
reverence. The priest places his left hand on the person’s head
and replies, Εὐλογία!—A blessing on thee.</p>

<p>A man must certainly be married before he enters the priesthood,
and even before he can obtain the degree of deacon; but it
is quite immaterial whether he be a father previous to or after
ordination.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

the Jassen or Yasses are fully and minutely described by the
Abbé Chappe d’Auteroche, who witnessed precisely like ceremonies
at Tobolsk, where marriages amongst the natives were
thus celebrated (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyage en Sibérie en 1761</cite>, etc., Paris, 1768, i,
163, <i>et seq.</i>). Olearius notices somewhat similar, but certainly
milder, doings at Moscow in his time (<cite>Voyages</cite>, etc., 243); and
Pitt (<cite>A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of
the Mahommetans</cite>, etc., Exon., 1704) recounts something of the

between the rivers Kour and Araxes, where Shah Rokh spent the
winter of 1420, being accompanied by his vassals; Khalyl Oullah,
the shah of Shirwan, and Minutcher, his own valorous brother,
being among his guests (Dorn, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch einer Gesch. d. Schirwan-Sch.</cite>,

the earliest times, either because the latter spoke an incomprehensible,
a dumb language, or, as Schafarik explains (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Slawische

and 1298 (Weil, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesch. der Chal.</cite>, iv, 55, 78, 213, 233). They had
frequently appeared in force in its neighbourhood, notably in 1278
(Makrizi by Quatremère, <span class="smcap">I</span>, i, 166), a date which nearly corresponds
with the year in which the city was taken; a statement that would
have been communicated to the author by his friends the Armenians,
the most interested in the fate of their capital. It need not
in this case be supposed that Schiltberger confounded the Mahomedan
with the Christian year, and that he conceived 655 of the
Hegira to correspond to 1277. In 655 or <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1257, Egypt was
in too disturbed a state for the sultan to trouble himself about the
conquest of Sis.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER LXIII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_63" id="Footnote_1_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_63">(1.)</a>  “when Saint Silvester was Pope at Rome.”—The Armenian
Church teaches that St. Thaddeus, one of the seventy-two
disciples of our Lord, and St. Bartholomew, one of the twelve
apostles, were the first to preach the gospel in Armenia; but the
actual conversion of the Armenians to Christianity was not
effected until the reign of Tiridates in the 4th century, by St.
Gregory, thenceforth named Lousarovitch—the Enlightener. He
was the son of a prince of Parthia, the assassin of Chosroes, king
of Armenia, who, though not a kinsman of Gregory, belonged to
the race of the Arsacidæ of Parthian origin; St. Gregory’s own
ancestors, the Surenians, being also a branch of the same royal
race. St. Gregory was, therefore, indeed a kinsman of Tiridates,
who was the son of Chosroes.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

has been already stated.”—It is singular that Bethlehem is not
mentioned at all in the chapter devoted to a description of the
holy places, so that it is just possible the Nuremberg MS. is a
copy of the MS. at Heidelberg, in which that city is not named.
Opinions are greatly divided upon this statement of Schiltberger.
In a communication from Bishop Aïvazoffsky, I am assured that no
church whatever was constructed prior to the king’s conversion;
but it is stated in an apocryphal writing, that Tiridates caused a
church to be built at Jerusalem after his conversion. On the
other hand, Vaillant de Florival (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire Historique</cite>, sub
vocem, Dertad) inserts that, after his conversion, the king ordered
the construction of many churches, one being at Bethlehem, and
dedicated to the nativity of Christ.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_63" id="Footnote_3_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_63">(3.)</a>  “The king again became a man, and was, with all his
people, again a Christian.”—This tradition in regard to Tiridates
and St. Gregory is told with considerable accuracy. Armenian
chroniclers relate that Gregory, having refused to worship the
idol set up by the king, was by his orders taken to the fortress in
the town of Ardashat, and there thrown into a stinking pit, to be
consumed, as we read in the text, by serpents and other reptiles,
but where he nevertheless remained miraculously preserved from
all harm during the space of fourteen, or, according to others,
fifteen years. The place situated in the valley of the Araxes, is
now called Khorvyrab—Dry well—the site of a monastery in
which is shown the saint’s dungeon.</p>

<p>Rhipsime, not Susanna, was the name of the beautiful maiden
the king sought to corrupt. She was a devout woman who had
fled the importunities of Diocletian, and with Guiane and many
other saintly persons of her sex, was put to a cruel death by Tiridates.
The story goes on to say that, for these persecutions of
Christians, Tiridates was smitten by the Lord, thereby losing his
reason and becoming like a wild beast; but his favourite sister,
Khosroivitouhdt, having had a vision, caused Gregory to be summoned
out of the pit. That holy man restored reason to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>king, who thereupon, with all his subjects, became converted to
Christianity (<cite>The Crimea and Transc.</cite>, i, 236, 243).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_63" id="Footnote_4_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_63">(4.)</a>  “the King Derthat and the man Gregory.”—Tiridates was
never at Babylon, nor was any Infidel people ever converted by
him to Christianity (Bishop Aïvazoffsky); but it should be borne
in mind that although the Chaldæans and Nestorians of Kourdistan
have nothing in common with the Armenians, they hold St.
Gregory in great veneration, as he was sent by Tiridates to
Cæsarea in Cappadocia to receive consecration at the hands of
St. Leontius, the metropolitan of that country. Schiltberger
would have done better to express himself to this effect, instead of
saying that St. Gregory was placed at the head of the church by
the king.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

Zenobius, a disciple of Gregory, speak of a journey to Rome that
was undertaken by those two personages circa 318–19, for the
purpose of seeing the Emperor Constantine and Pope Silvester,
and concluding with them a treaty of peace and friendship. They
remained at Rome one month, and returned to Armenia charged
with honours. Moses of Chorene, the catholicos John, Stephen
Assolic, and other Armenian historians prior to the 11th century,
are united in support of this record of Agathange and Zenobius.
Later, during the First and Second Crusades, exaggerated and
absurd details, such as those related by Schiltberger, were fabricated;
and a monstrous document purporting to be the treaty of
peace between Constantine and Tiridates—Sylvester and Gregory,
called Tought-tashantz—The Convention—was invented and published
after the manner of the false Decretales.</p>

<p>It is in consequence of this controverted document that Armeno-Catholics
and other Armenians have enunciated principles and
details, such as we read in part in the text (Bishop Aïvazoffsky).</p>

<p>Whilst admitting the fairness of the bishop’s observation, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>would point out that Schiltberger was simply a ready listener to
what the natives, who did not even belong to the Church of Rome,
believed to be true; and to what were maintained as incontrovertible
facts by the Armeno-Catholics, who in his time were by
far the more numerous.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_64" id="Footnote_2_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_64">(2.)</a>  “a king they call Takchauer.”—Cantemir believes that
Tekiour is a corruption of τοῦ Κυρίου, and he adds that previous
to the conquest of Constantinople, the emperors were called by
the Turks, Stamboul Tekioury or Takfoury—Masters of the City.
Takavor is the Armenian for king.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER LXV.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_65" id="Footnote_1_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_65">(1.)</a>  “Gregory taught the Christian faith ... as is above
stated.”—The Armenians believe, and are prepared to prove, that
none of the dogmas of their faith, as they were received from St.
Gregory, have undergone any change, and this is why they distinguish
themselves as being Gregorians in opposition to Armeno-Catholics.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_65" id="Footnote_2_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_65">(2.)</a>  “then he must say it himself, right through.”—The
priest prepares several small loaves, but consecrates one only,
and alone recites the prayers and psalms during the preparation.
He celebrates the Mass unassisted, other priests performing the
functions of deacons in their absence. The practice of Low Mass
among the Armenians serves to prove, that the greater number
of that people met by Schiltberger were Armeno-Catholics.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_65" id="Footnote_3_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_65">(3.)</a>  “They place much confidence in our religion.”—This
passage in Neumann’s edition stands thus: “Sie machent vil
geuartiezi unsers geloubes.” The word “geuartiezi” does not
appear in the editions of 1475 (?), 1549 and 1814; Neumann does
not explain it; Koehler (<cite>Germania</cite>, etc., <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">herausgegeben von</cite> F.
Pfeifer; Wien, vii, 1862), who undertook to correct the errors of
Neumann, asks “Was ist geuartiezi?” and Professor Bruun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>(Russian edition) believes it to be untranslatable, although he
thinks the author meant to imply that the Armenian had borrowed
largely from the Roman Catholic Church, or at all events that the
one assimilated the other in its types and ceremonies.</p>

<p>The word “geuärd” occurs in chapter 20, and is possibly
intended for gewähr; I have rendered it as “right”, or justification
from a sense of confidence. Timour’s youngest wife (see
page 29) was anxious to satisfy her lord, that the letter and ring
had been sent to her by one of his vassals without any assurance,
any confidence on her part, to warrant him in so doing. It
appears to me, considering the careless manner in which the
transcriber has performed his work in other places, that a similar
interpretation is to be applied to “geuartiezi” as to “geuärd”; the
words that immediately follow implying prepossession on the part
of the Armenians in favour of the Church of Rome—“they also
willingly go to Mass in our churches, which the Greeks do not”;
apparently because “They place much confidence (have much
faith) in our religion”.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_4_65" id="Footnote_4_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_65">(4.)</a>  “a saint named Aurencius.”—St. Auxentius, priest-martyr,
is fêted in the Armeno-Catholic Church on December 25th, and in
the Greek Church on December 13th, N. S.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_5_65" id="Footnote_5_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_65">(5.)</a>  “Saint James the Great.”—St. James the Apostle is confounded

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_6_65" id="Footnote_6_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_65">(6.)</a>  “his name is Zerlichis.”—Sarghis, St. Sergius, was a martyr.
The Armenians celebrate his festival fifteen days before Lent.
The Armeno-Catholics keep the day on February 24th, and the

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_7_65" id="Footnote_7_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_65">(7.)</a>  “our Lady’s day in Lent, which they do not hold as we
do.”—The Armenians do not fast in the name of the Twelve
Apostles, and the Ave Maria occurs only in the services of the
Armeno-Catholics. On the day of the Annunciation of the Virgin
Mary, a hymn is chanted, in which are introduced the words that
were spoken to Mary by the Angel.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

prayers are daily repeated over a grave for the space of a week,
and each person attending throws a handful of earth on it as
prescribed by the rubric; but the gradual interment is an invention.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_9_65" id="Footnote_9_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_65">(9.)</a>  “God forgive thee thy sins.”—Asstwadz toghoukhyoùn ta
mekhytt, is here intended for the words of absolution pronounced
by the priest; but it would be more correct to say—Asstwadz
toghoukhuyoùn schnorhestzè—May God grant you absolution. For
“Ogoruicka” we should read Ogormya or Ogormyha, the modern
phrase being: Ter voghormyà yndz—Lord have mercy upon us; but
Meghà Asdoutzò—I have sinned before God—is more commonly
said by the people.—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_10_65" id="Footnote_10_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_65">(10.)</a>  “counts, and knights, who are subject to him.”—The
Armeno-Catholics adopted Low Mass at the commencement of the
14th century. In ancient times prayers were offered for the
sovereign and all Christian kings and princes; but never specially
for the Roman emperor.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_11_65" id="Footnote_11_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_65">(11.)</a>  “if a priest teaches the Word of God, but does not
understand and attend to it, he commits a sin.”—There is more to
confirm than to reject in the information contained in this chapter.</p>

<p>The patriarch must be elected by the unanimous voice of the
dignitaries of the Church, who assemble at the patriarchal seat
from all parts for the purpose. This has ever been the custom;
but since the annexation of Etchmiadzin to Russia, the choice is
subject to the emperor’s approval.</p>

<p>The preparation of the wafer by women is quite out of the
question, and it is also forbidden to laymen by the 22nd Canon of
the pontiff Leon; this duty is performed by deacons as well as
priests, who first communicate and then administer to the people.
In reading the Gospel, the priest faces the congregation, thereby
turning his back to the altar, so that the people necessarily look
towards the East.</p>

<p>That a priest should separate himself from his wife for three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>days before and one day after he celebrates the Mass, is strictly in
accordance with the Canons of St. Thaddeus; but the observance
has become even more stringent in modern times, the priest being
required to leave his home and retire to his church during the
space of eight days before officiating.</p>

<p>A Canon addressed by Macarius, bishop of Jerusalem, to the
pontiff Vertanes, circa 340, requires that the altar shall be
furnished with a curtain; a curtain shall likewise fall in front of
the sanctuary, within which only the minister celebrating the
Mass may enter, other ministers present taking their seats outside
according to precedence. This rule has become relaxed in modern
times, for deacons as well as priests may now stand at the altar.</p>

<p>As in the Greek Church, no female quæ sit menstrua, may enter
a sacred edifice.</p>

<p>It is always the godfather who carries an infant into church for
baptism. If the child to be baptised is out of its infancy, it is
conducted by a servant of the Church.</p>

<p>Divorce is not to be obtained in the Armenian Church, except
in cases of adultery, impotence, and a permanently foul breath.</p>

<p>There is no ykonostass or altar screen as in the Russo-Greek
church; but an image, that is to say a painting on canvas or
panel, graven images not being tolerated, is always over the altar
in the middle of the pem, a raised course in the centre aisle, that
is kept covered with carpets, silk, cloth of silver or gold, on which
are laid candlesticks, the censer, and a Bible resting on a piece of
silk, for the priest does not touch the book with his hands.</p>

<p>The clergy do not pretend to having the power of absolving the
penitent; absolution is pronounced in the name of the Almighty.</p>

<p>“Very gorgeous and majestic”, says Dr. Issaverdens, “are the
garments which the Armenians make use of in their religious
ceremonies.”</p>

<p>Whatever the restriction in Schiltberger’s time, it is certain
that all are now free to read the Gospel. That the contrary was
ever the case is denied.</p>

<p>The “varthabiet”—Vartabied—is a doctor of divinity possessing
knowledge of all holy science, and of all that concerns the study of
the Holy Scriptures, of the Fathers, the Councils, and of dogmatical,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>moral, and disputed theology. The Vartabieds are the
first to be consulted in all controversies on religion, its rites, and
all ecclesiastical discipline (Issaverdens, <cite>Armenia and the Armenians</cite>,
ii, 413, 486; Bishop Meyerditch Kherimian, <em>communicated</em>;
<cite>The Crimea and Transc.</cite>, i, 207).—<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER LXVI.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_66" id="Footnote_1_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_66">(1.)</a>  “that it might be said that thirty Greeks were given for
an onion.”—This battle between the Armenians and Greeks has
reference in all probability to the triumph of Thoros II., or
Theodore of the Roupenian dynasty, over Andronicus, who entered
Cilicia at the head of an invading army, with instructions from
the emperor to seize the king and bind him in chains. Finlay
(<cite>Hist. of the Byzantine and Greek Empires</cite>, ii, 242) characterises
the two reverses met with by that general in Cilicia, as shameful
defeats. Armenian historiographers (Chamich, <cite>Hist. of Armenia</cite>,
ii, 195; Issaverdens, <cite>Armenia and the Armenians</cite>, i, 300) enter
more largely into details, and describe the great slaughter of
Greeks and the multitude of prisoners made, among whom were
many chiefs, Andronicus himself effecting his escape with the
greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>The emperor being greatly concerned upon learning that a large
number of his men remained in the victor’s hands, sent ambassadors
to treat for their ransom. “If these people were of any use
to me,” said Thoros, “I would not part with them, but as they
are not, take them for what you choose.” The reply to this taunt
was the dispatch of a large sum of money to the king, for the emperor
wished to shew that his men were indeed of great value; but upon
seeing the treasure, the king exclaimed with affected astonishment:
“What! are my captives truly worth so much?” and ordered that
the whole of the money should be distributed among his troops.
The ambassadors stood amazed at this munificence, and Thoros
merely observed to them: “I reward my soldiers that they may
again take your chiefs;” which they did do upon the second invasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>by Andronicus, again receiving large sums of money in
exchange for the prisoners they made. Chamich sets these
events as occurring in the year 1146, and Issaverdens in 1144;
but, according to Dr. Leo Alishan of the Mechitaristic Society
at Venice, author of <cite>Nerses the Graceful, and his Times</cite>, and
other historical works, Thoros II. fought and won about the
year 1152. This appears to be the only episode in the history of
the Byzantine Empire and of the kingdom of Armenia, that in any
degree assimilates the absurdly exaggerated tale of victory invented
by those Armenian friends to whom Schiltberger, upon
more occasions than this, was too ready to listen.</p>

<p>A curious incident at the close of the late Russo-Turkish war
is worth relating, with reference to Schiltberger’s version of the
value set upon the Greek prisoners. The Porte having entertained
the idea of raising the taxation, the Armenians determined upon
opposing the measure with vigour, and they accordingly destroyed
the house of the Turkish Mudjir; after which, the Armenian
women planted onions and garlic over the ruins—an act that is
looked upon as a sign of the greatest contempt.—(<cite>The Times</cite>, September
26th, 1878.)</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER LXVII.</h3>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_1_67" id="Footnote_1_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_67">(1.)</a>  “Sant Masicia.”—This is the ancient Amastris, now called
Amasserah. The architecture of its walls of defence bears witness
to Genoese occupation, the earliest date of which is not known.
In 1346, Amastris was included in the empire of the Palæologi,
after having belonged to Nicæa, but it is certain that the Genoese
were in possession previous to 1398 (Heyd, <cite>d. Ital. Handelscolon</cite>,
etc., in the <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift f. d. gesammte Staatswissenschaft</cite>, xviii, 712),
at which date they had a consul there. Clavijo calls Amastris,
visited by him a few years later, a Genoese town, where he saw
many remains of ancient splendour.</p>

<p>After being for a long time a dependency of the Central Administration
at Caffa, Samastris, by a decree of 1449, became subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>to that of Pera to which it had previously belonged, but had
been detached “propter inopiam et imbecilitatem loci ipsius Pere”
(<cite>Zap. Odess. Obstschest.</cite>, v, 810). Under these circumstances it is
very probable that the Genoese were at Samastris at a still earlier
period than that indicated by Heyd. According to Hammer (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hist.
de l’E. O.</cite>, iii, 69), this city fell into the hands of the Turks in
the campaign of 1461, together with Sinope and Trebizond.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_2_67" id="Footnote_2_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_67">(2.)</a>  “one hundred are quite of brass.”—Schiltberger is scarcely
to be charged with exaggeration, if we consider what Manuel
Chrysoloras has said of these walls. “I cannot conceive the walls
of Constantinople, in regard to their extent and circuit, to have
been inferior to those of Babylon. The towers are without
number; the proportions and height of any one tower sufficed to
astonish the beholder, and their construction and the large
flights of steps excited universal admiration.”</p>

<p>In stating that there were one thousand churches, the author
intended to convey the idea that they were very numerous;
indeed Clavijo estimated the number at three thousand. Schiltberger
appears to have been too much dazzled by the magnificence
of the church of St. Sophia, to think of entering more largely
upon a description of it as others have done.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote2"><p><a name="Footnote_3_67" id="Footnote_3_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_67">(3.)</a>  “A city called Asparseri.”—This is Ak-kerman, a name
which is the equivalent for Byelgorod, the Slave for White-Town,
a place mentioned in the Russian and Polish chronicles of the
middle ages—called Tchetate Alba by the Moldavians, and by
the Maghyars, Feierwar, not Feriena as it appears through a
printer’s error in Dlugocz (<cite>Hist. Poloniæ</cite> etc., xi, 324).</p>

<p>The Greeks of the Lower Empire changed the name from
White-Town to Mavrocastron, turned by the Italians into Mocastro
and Moncastro, as we find it in De Lannoy, Barbaro, and others.</p>

<p>There are good grounds for the supposition that the name White
was given originally by the Greeks, because the Aspron mentioned
by Constantine Porphyrogenitus (<cite>De Adm. Imp.</cite>, 167) should
be looked for in this locality, notwithstanding that the emperor
situates it on the Dnieper, a scribe’s error for Dniester. I know of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>no author who speaks of a White-Town on the Lower Dnieper, and
the emperor himself describes the place to which he alludes, as
being situated on the bank of the river nearest to Bulgaria.</p>

<p>It would appear that the ancient name was not forgotten by
the Greeks after they had changed it to Mavrocastron, because
some authors of the latter part of the middle ages have alluded
to the place as Leucopolichnion or Asprocastron; in all probability
identical with “Asparseri”, and certainly to be distinguished from
White-Town, but a distinction that is to be attributed to a
mistake on the part of the transcriber. How otherwise are we
to account for the appearance in the Heidelberg MS., of the
native name Asparsaraï—White-Town—and for the statement in
the Nuremberg MS. (Penzel’s edition) that Schiltberger took his
departure, not from Asparsaraï but from White-Town, direct for
Soutchava<a name="FNanchor_1_67a" id="FNanchor_1_67a"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67a" class="fnanchor">1</a> at that time the chief city of Little Walachia or
Mavrovlachia as Moldavia was then called.</p>

<p>Grecian colonists were attracted to the neighbourhood of modern
Ak-kerman in very remote times. The Tyrites of Herodotus
lived there, probably at Ophiussa, a city known to Strabo. There,
also, flourished Tyras, to be identified perhaps with Turis, ceded
by the emperor Justinian, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 547, to the Antes, a Slave tribe
which may have been the first to give the name of Byelgorod to
the place which Edrisi certainly had in his mind, when he wrote
about the Coman city distant one day’s journey from the mouth
of the Danube, called Akliba; a name composed of two Turkish
words, Ak and liva—White District—and therefore possibly the
Coman designation for the “White City” of Schiltberger, the
Akkerman of Aboulfeda.—<span class="smcap">Bruun.</span></p></div>

<p class="center">REPORT FOR 1879.</p>

<p>The Council of the Hakluyt Society have pleasure in being
able to report to the Members that their numbers are
increasing, and that the funds are in a satisfactory state.
The number of effective Members of the Society is now
240.</p>

<p>The attention of the Council has been given to an
arrangement which will facilitate the completion of sets of
volumes by old Members, and the acquisition of back
volumes which they may desire to possess by new Members
who may not wish to purchase complete sets. The whole
series can now be purchased at the rate of 8s. 6d. a volume;
namely, for £24 4s. 6d., the price increasing at the rate of
8s. 6d. as each new volume is added. The same rule applies
when a Member requires any portion of the series equal to,
or exceeding, a quarter of the whole number of volumes.
When a Member requires a single back volume, or any
number less than a quarter of the whole series, he may,
with the consent of the Council, be supplied at the rate of
10s. each volume.</p>

<p>Since the last Report the following volume has been issued

several other works have been undertaken by editors.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
